We know that 12 is 3/4 of the total number of notecards, so we can set up an equation:\n\n12 = (3/4) x\n\nwhere x is the total number of notecards we had. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3/4:\n\n12 \u00f7 (3/4) = x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n16 = x\n\nSo we originally had 16 notecards. \n\nTo find out how many notecards we had completed before the dog ate 12 of them, we need to subtract 12 from 16:\n\n16 - 12 = 4\n\nSo we had completed 4 notecards before the dog ate 12 of them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: 4.", "prompt_tokens": 55, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 261}

What is the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold?", "response": "Let's call the number of packs of Vitamin A supplements sold 'a' and the number of packs of Vitamin D supplements sold 'd'. \n\nWe know that the store sold equal quantities of both, so:\n\na = d \n\nWe also know that the Vitamin A supplements come in packs of 7 and the Vitamin D supplements come in packs of 17. So the total number of Vitamin A supplements sold would be 7 times the number of packs of Vitamin A sold (7a) and the total number of Vitamin D supplements sold would be 17 times the number of packs of Vitamin D sold (17d). \n\nSince the store sold equal quantities of both, the total number of Vitamin A supplements sold must be equal to the total number of Vitamin D supplements sold:\n\n7a = 17d \n\nWe want to find the smallest number of packs of each type that the store could have sold. This means we want to find the smallest values of 'a' and 'd' that satisfy the equation above. \n\nWe can start by dividing both sides of the equation by the greatest common factor of 7 and 17, which is 1:\n\n7a / 1 = 17d / 1 \n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n7a = 17d \n\nNow we need to find two numbers that satisfy this equation and are equal to each other.

Determine the speed of the stream and that of boat in still water.", "response": "Let's call the speed of the boat in still water 'b' and the speed of the stream 's'.\n\nTo solve for these values, we can set up a system of equations using the information we have:\n\nEquation 1: 30/(b-s) + 44/(b+s) = 10\n\nThis equation represents the fact that the boat traveled 30 km upstream and 44 km downstream in 10 hours.\n\nEquation 2: 40/(b-s) + 55/(b+s) = 13\n\nThis equation represents the fact that the boat traveled 40 km upstream and 55 km downstream in 13 hours.\n\nNow we can solve for b and s using these equations.\n\nFirst, we'll simplify the equations by multiplying both sides by the common denominator of (b-s)(b+s):\n\nEquation 1: 30(b+s) + 44(b-s) = 10(b-s)(b+s)\n\nEquation 2: 40(b+s) + 55(b-s) = 13(b-s)(b+s)\n\nExpanding the right side of each equation gives:\n\nEquation 1: 30(b+s) + 44(b-s) = 10(b^2 - s^2)\n\nEquation 2: 40(b+s) + 55(b-s) = 13(b^2 - s^2)\n\nSimplifying further by distributing gives:\n\nEquation 1: 74b - 14s = 10b^2 - 10s^2\n\nEquation 2: 95b + 15s = 13b^2 - 13s^2\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables.

What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?", "response": "To find the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 840 and 440, and then divide by 2 since there are two riders.\n\nTo find the GCF, we can list the factors of each number:\n\n- Factors of 840: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 35, 40, 42, 56, 60, 70, 84, 120, 140, 168, 210, 280, 420, 840\n- Factors of 440: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 20, 22, 40, 44, 55, 88, 110, 220, 440\n\nThe greatest common factor of 840 and 440 is 40. So each cyclist can bike 40 miles per day if they want to cover equal distances each day. Therefore, each cyclist will need to bike for 21 days to complete their respective trips (840/40 = 21 and 440/40 = 11).", "prompt_tokens": 67, "completion_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 355}

She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?", "response": "Let's start by converting the amount into cents: $1.20 = 120 cents.\n\nLet's also use the variables 'q' and 'd' to represent the number of quarters and dimes, respectively.\n\nWe know that the total number of coins is minimized, which means we need to find the combination of quarters and dimes that adds up to 120 cents with the smallest possible number of coins.\n\nEach quarter is worth 25 cents, so we can write:\n\n25q + 10d = 120\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n5q + 2d = 24\n\nNow we can start trying different values of 'q' and 'd' that satisfy this equation and see which combination gives us the smallest number of coins.\n\nIf we let 'q' be 4 and 'd' be 8, we get:\n\n5(4) + 2(8) = 28\n\nThis adds up to 28 cents, which is too high. We need to decrease the number of dimes and increase the number of quarters.\n\nIf we let 'q' be 6 and 'd' be 3, we get:\n\n5(6) + 2(3) = 33\n\nThis adds up to 33 cents, which is too high as well.\n\nIf we let 'q' be 5 and 'd' be 2, we get:\n\n5(5) + 2(2) = 27\n\nThis adds up to 27 cents, which is getting closer.\n\nIf we let 'q' be 5 and 'd' be 1, we get:\n\n5(5) + 2(1) = 27\n\nThis adds up to 27 cents as well, and it's the smallest possible combination of coins that adds up to 120 cents.\n\nTherefore, Kira has 5 quarters and 1 dime, for a total of 6 coins.", "prompt_tokens": 41, "completion_tokens": 401, "total_tokens": 442}

How many arrangements can she make with those flowers so that, there is no flower left.", "response": "First, we need to calculate the total number of flowers Jessica has: \n\n8 + 12 + 48 = 68\n\nNow we need to find the number of arrangements she can make with those 68 flowers. We can use the formula for permutations with repetition, which is: \n\nn! / (n1! x n2! x ... x nk!) \n\nwhere n is the total number of objects, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of objects that are indistinguishable from each other (in this case, the number of each type of flower). \n\nUsing this formula, we get: \n\n68! / (8! x 12! x 48!) \n\nThis simplifies to: \n\n(68 x 67 x 66 x ... x 61 x 60 x 59) / (8 x 7 x 6 x ... x 2 x 1 x 12 x 11 x ... x 2 x 1 x 48 x 47 x ... x 2 x 1) \n\nWe can simplify this further by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator: \n\n(68 x 67 x 66 x ... x 61 x 60 x 59) / (8 x 7 x 6 x ... x 2 x 1) / (12 x 11 x ... x 2 x 1) / (48 x 47 x ... x 2 x 1) \n\nThis gives us: \n\n(68 x 67 x 66 x ... x 61 x 60 x 59) / (8 x 7 x 6 x ... x 2 x 1) / (12 x 11 x ... x 2 x 1) / (48 x 47 x ... x 2 x 1) \n\nNow we can use a calculator to find the value of the numerator and denominator separately: \n\nNumerator: 68 x 67 x 66 x ... x 61 x 60 x 59 = 6.067 x 10^24 \n\nDenominator: (8 x 7 x 6 x ... x 2 x 1) x (12 x 11 x ... x 2 x 1) x (48 x 47 x ... x 2 x 1) = 7.913 x 10^23 \n\nFinally, we can divide the numerator by the denominator to get the total number of arrangements: \n\n(6.067 x 10^24) / (7.913 x 10^23) = 7.67 \n\nTherefore, Jessica can make 7.67 (or approximately 8) different arrangements with the 8 roses, 12 daisies, and 48 marigolds. However, since she cannot have a fraction of a flower, we need to round this answer down to 7 arrangements.", "prompt_tokens": 58, "completion_tokens": 595, "total_tokens": 653}
