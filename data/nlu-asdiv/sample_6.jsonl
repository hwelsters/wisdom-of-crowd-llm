Thus, the baker made 49 full boxes of brownies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The baker made 49 full boxes of brownies.", "prompt_tokens": 45, "completion_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 217}

We know that:\n\n- Each muffin package has 18 muffins\n- Each cookie package has 5 cookies\n- The total number of muffins sold is equal to the total number of cookies sold\n\nSo we can set up an equation:\n\n18m = 5c\n\nWe want to find the smallest number of muffins sold, which means we want to find the smallest possible value for 'm'. One way to do this is to find the smallest value for 'c' that makes the equation true. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 5, and then dividing that by 5 to get a value for 'c'.\n\nThe LCM of 18 and 5 is 90 (you can find this by listing the multiples of each and finding the first one they have in common). So:\n\n18m = 5c\n18m = 90\nm = 5\n\nSo the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold is 5 packages of 18 muffins, or 90 muffins. And since they sold the same number of cookies, they must have sold 18 cookies per package and a total of 5 packages of cookies, or 90 cookies.", "prompt_tokens": 75, "completion_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 354}

If the last full moon occurred on a Friday, how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday?", "response": "There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use modular arithmetic. We know that a full moon occurs every 30 days, so we can write:\n\nx \u2261 0 (mod 30)\n\nThis means that x is a multiple of 30. We also know that the last full moon occurred on a Friday, which we can represent as:\n\nx \u2261 5 (mod 7)\n\nThis means that x is congruent to 5 modulo 7, or in other words, x leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7. Combining these two congruences, we can write:\n\nx \u2261 0 (mod 30)\nx \u2261 5 (mod 7)\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or simply test some values. One way to do the latter is to add 30 to the previous solution until we get a value that satisfies both congruences. For example, if the last full moon occurred on January 29th (a Friday), we can start with x = 30 and check:\n\n30 \u2261 0 (mod 30)\n30 \u2261 2 (mod 7)\n\n30 + 30 = 60\n60 \u2261 0 (mod 30)\n60 \u2261 4 (mod 7)\n\n60 + 30 = 90\n90 \u2261 0 (mod 30)\n90 \u2261 6 (mod 7)\n\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 \u2261 0 (mod 30)\n120 \u2261 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo the next full moon that occurs on a Friday will be 120 days after the last one, which is May 28th.", "prompt_tokens": 49, "completion_tokens": 359, "total_tokens": 408}

We know that Amanda's band plays sets of 2 songs, so the total number of songs they played is 2a. Similarly, Sadie's band plays sets of 9 songs, so the total number of songs they played is 9s.\n\nWe also know that the two bands played the same number of songs, so:\n\n2a = 9s\n\nTo find the smallest possible values of 'a' and 's', we want to find the smallest common multiple of 2 and 9. That's because the number of sets that Amanda's band played is an integer, so 2a must be a multiple of 9. Similarly, the number of sets that Sadie's band played is an integer, so 9s must be a multiple of 2.\n\nThe smallest common multiple of 2 and 9 is 18.

(Use the value of pi = 3.14)", "response": "The distance around the lake (circumference) is C = \u03c0d = 3.14 \u00d7 2 = 6.28 miles.\nHalf of the diameter is the radius (r) of the circle, which equals 1 mile.\nThe distance across the lake (the diameter) is 2 miles.\nTo find the length of the arc (the distance Chad would walk) if he walks around the lake, we need to know what fraction of the circle he will be walking around. This is given by the angle that the arc subtends at the center of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle cuts it into two equal halves, the angle Chad will be walking around is 180 degrees.\nThe length of the arc is given by the formula L = (180/360) \u00d7 C = 0.5 \u00d7 6.28 = 3.14 miles.\nTherefore, the distance Chad would walk around the lake is 3.14 miles.\nThe distance Chad will canoe across is just the diameter of the circle, which is 2 miles.\nThe difference between these two distances is 3.14 - 2 = 1.14 miles.\nTherefore, Chad's trip will be 1.14 miles shorter if he canoes across the lake rather than walks around it.", "prompt_tokens": 74, "completion_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 337}

Rick ate 11 candy bars. Todd gave away 18 of his candy bars. How many more candy bars did Rick have than Todd then?", "response": "There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use subtraction. If we let x be the initial number of candy bars that Rick and Todd had, then we can write two equations based on the given information:\n\nRick had x - 11 candy bars after eating 11 of them.\nTodd had x - 18 candy bars after giving away 18 of them.\n\nTo find how many more candy bars Rick had than Todd after these actions, we can subtract Todd's amount from Rick's amount:\n\nx - 11 - (x - 18) = 18 - 11\n\nSimplifying both sides and cancelling out the x terms, we get:\n\n7 = 7\n\nThis equation is true, which means that the original problem doesn't have a unique solution. In other words, we could have different values of x that satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n\nOne way to see this is to use a concrete example. Suppose that Rick and Todd had 20 candy bars each at the beginning. Then after Rick ate 11 of them, he had 9 left. After Todd gave away 18 of them, he had only 2 left. Therefore, at that point, Rick had 7 more candy bars than Todd. However, if we had started with a different number of candy bars, the difference between Rick's and Todd's amounts could have been different.", "prompt_tokens": 55, "completion_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 336}

At the next bus stop, 5 people got on and 2 people got off. Two stops later, 7 people got on 15 people got off the bus at the terminal station. How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?", "response": "We don't know the exact number of people on the bus when Jose got on, but we can use the information given to figure it out. \n\nLet's keep track of the changes in the number of people on the bus:\n\n- When Jose got on: unknown number of people\n- Next stop: +5 people (total number of people on bus is now unknown + 5)\n- Two stops later: +7 people, -15 people (total number of people on bus is now unknown + 5 + 7 - 15)\n\nTo figure out the unknown number of people when Jose got on the bus, we can simplify the changes:\n\n- 5 + 7 = 12 people got on the bus\n- 2 + 15 = 17 people got off the bus\n- Net change = 12 - 17 = -5 people\n\nThis means that there were 5 fewer people on the bus when Jose got on compared to the terminal station. So, if we add back the 17 people who got off at the terminal station, we get:\n\nunknown number of people + 5 - 17 = -12\n\nThis doesn't make sense as the number of people on the bus can't be negative.

It doesn't make sense for more people to get off the bus than were ever on the bus, especially since we know that the net change was -5 people.

In this case, the total number of parts is 9 + 2 = 11. \n\nTo find how many bookmarks were sold, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts were bookmarks. \n\nWe can set up a proportion: \n\nbooks/bookmarks = 9/2 \n\nLet's call the number of bookmarks sold 'b'. We know that the number of books sold was 72, so we can set up another proportion: \n\nbooks/total parts = 72/11 \n\nNow we can solve for the total number of parts: \n\nbooks/total parts = 72/11 \n\n9/total parts = 72/11 \n\ntotal parts = (9/72) x 11 = 1.375 \n\nSo the total number of parts sold was 1.375 times the number of books sold, or: \n\ntotal parts = 1.375 x 72 = 99 \n\nNow we can use the ratio to find how many bookmarks were sold: \n\nbooks/bookmarks = 9/2 \n\n9/11 = books/99 \n\nbooks = (9/11) x 99 = 81 \n\nSo the store sold 81 books and 18 bookmarks.", "prompt_tokens": 47, "completion_tokens": 262, "total_tokens": 309}

Pens come in packages of 12, but pencils are sold in packages of 15. If Philip wishes to purchase the same number of pens as pencils, what is the smallest number of pens that he can buy?", "response": "To start, we can write out that Philip wants to buy: \n\n12p = 15c \n\nwhere p represents the number of packages of pens and c represents the number of packages of pencils. \n\nTo find the smallest number of pens Philip can buy, we want to find the smallest whole number values of p and c that satisfy this equation. \n\nWe can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: \n\n4p = 5c \n\nThis tells us that p must be a multiple of 5 (since 4 is not divisible by 5) and that c must be a multiple of 4 (since 5 is not divisible by 4). \n\nThe smallest multiple of 5 is 5 itself, so we can try setting p = 5: \n\n4(5) = 20 \n\nSo if Philip buys 5 packages of pens, he needs to buy 20 packages of pencils to get the same number of writing utensils. \n\nHowever, we can check that this doesn't quite satisfy the original equation: \n\n12(5) = 60 \n\n15(20) = 300 \n\nThis means that 5 packages of pens and 20 packages of pencils is too many pencils - we need to decrease the number of pencils and increase the number of pens. \n\nTo do this, we can try increasing the value of p until we find a value that works. \n\nIf we set p = 10, then: \n\n4(10) = 5c \n\nc = 8 \n\nThis means that 10 packages of pens and 8 packages of pencils will give Philip the same number of writing utensils. \n\nChecking: \n\n12(10) = 120 \n\n15(8) = 120 \n\nSo this solution works! \n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pens that Philip can buy to have the same number of writing utensils as pencils is 10 packages.", "prompt_tokens": 68, "completion_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 457}

Since the ratio of up votes to down votes is 9:2, we can write this as:\n\n9x + 2x = total number of votes\n\nwhere x is a constant that allows us to scale the ratio. Simplifying this equation, we get:\n\n11x = total number of votes\n\nNow we know that the total number of votes is 18 (the number of up votes), so we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n\n11x = 18\n\nx = 18/11\n\nx \u2248 1.64\n\nThis tells us that for every 9 up votes, there are 2 down votes, or roughly 1.64 down votes for every 9 up votes.

She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?", "response": "Let's start by figuring out the value of each coin. Since Kira has only quarters and dimes, we know that:\n\n- The value of a quarter is 25 cents or $0.25\n- The value of a dime is 10 cents or $0.10\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many of each type of coin Kira has. Let's call the number of quarters she has 'q' and the number of dimes she has 'd'. We can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n- The total value of the coins is $1.20: \n\n0.25q + 0.10d = 1.20 \n\n- Kira has minimized the number of coins altogether: \n\nq + d = min\n\nWe don't know the exact value for 'min,' but we can use some logic to narrow down the possibilities. Since quarters are worth more than dimes, Kira would want to use as few quarters as possible to reach $1.20. If she used all quarters, she would have 4 of them, which would be worth $1.00. That would leave her with $0.20 to make up using dimes, which is equivalent to 2 dimes. So the total number of coins would be 4 quarters + 2 dimes = 6 coins.\n\nBut wait - we also need to check if there's a way for Kira to use even fewer coins to reach $1.20. Let's try some other combinations:\n\n- 3 quarters + 9 dimes: \n\n0.25(3)+0.10(9) = $1.05, which is less than $1.20\n\n- 2 quarters + 18 dimes: \n\n0.25(2)+0.10(18) = $1.80, which is more than $1.20\n\nSo it looks like the first combination we tried is the one that uses the fewest coins.

We know from the problem that:\n\nx + y = 15 \n\nWe also know that when the number is decreased by 27 and the digits are reversed, the new number is formed by putting y in the tens place and x in the ones place. So the new number is:\n\n10y + x - 27 \n\nWe want to find the original number, which is just x and y concatenated together. To do this, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other in one of the equations, and then substitute that expression into the other equation. Let's solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\ny = 15 - x \n\nNow we can substitute this equation into the second equation:\n\n10(15 - x) + x - 27 \n\nExpanding the brackets and simplifying, we get:\n\n150 - 9x \n\nSo the original number is just x and y concatenated:\n\nxy = 10x + y = 10x + (15 - x) = 9x + 15 \n\nAnd we know that this is equal to:\n\n150 - 9x \n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other and solving for x, we get:\n\n9x + 15 = 150 - 9x \n\n18x = 135 \n\nx = 7.5 \n\nBut x must be a whole number (since it's a digit), so this solution doesn't work.

One way to do this is to list out multiples of 5 and multiples of 11 until we find two that are equal:\n\n5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, ...\n\n11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, ...\n\nWe can see that 55 is the first number that appears on both lists. So, if Enzo played 11 games (earning 5 tickets per game), he would have won 55 tickets. Similarly, if Beatriz played 5 games (earning 11 tickets per game), she would have also won 55 tickets. Therefore, the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played is 11.", "prompt_tokens": 87, "completion_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 417}

Later, he buys 3 bats and 5 balls for $1750. Find the cost of each bat and each ball.", "response": "Let's call the cost of one bat 'b' and the cost of one ball 'c'. \nFrom the first sentence of the problem, we know that: \n7b + 6c = 3800 \nFrom the second sentence, we know that: \n3b + 5c = 1750 \nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination: \n\nFirst, we want to get the coefficients of one of the variables to be the same in both equations (so that we can add or subtract the equations to eliminate that variable). Let's focus on the 'b' terms. \nWe can multiply the second equation by 7/3, because 7/3 times 3/7 equals 1 (so we're not really changing the equation, just multiplying everything by the same amount): \n\n(7/3) * (3b + 5c) = (7/3) * 1750 \nSimplifying: \n7b + (35/3)c = 4083.33 \nNow we can subtract the first equation (7b + 6c = 3800) from this one: \n\n(7b + (35/3)c) - (7b + 6c) = 4083.33 - 3800 \nSimplifying: \n(11/3)c = 283.33 \nDividing both sides by 11/3: \nc = 81.82 \n\nNow we know that one ball costs $81.82. We can substitute this value back into either of the original equations to find the cost of one bat. Let's choose the first equation: \n\n7b + 6c = 3800 \nSubstituting c = 81.82: \n7b + 6(81.82) = 3800 \nSimplifying: \n7b + 491.52 = 3800 \nSubtracting 491.52 from both sides: \n7b = 3308.48 \nDividing both sides by 7: \nb = 472.64 \n\nSo one bat costs $472.64 and one ball costs $81.82.", "prompt_tokens": 60, "completion_tokens": 462, "total_tokens": 522}

An employee is surprised to discover that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles last week. What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?", "response": "Let's call the number of boxes of soap sold 'x'. We know that the shop sold an equal number of bars and bottles, so the total number of bars sold must be a multiple of 5 and the total number of bottles sold must be a multiple of 19.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n5x = 19y\n\nwhere 'y' represents the number of boxes of bottles sold. We want to find the smallest possible values of x and y that satisfy this equation.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use trial and error.

Since a negative number of Jawbreakers doesn't make sense in this context, we know Sarah must have started with more than 20. \n\n4. Figure out how many Jawbreakers Sarah had to start with by adding the 20 she ate to the number she has left over. Let's call that number 'x'. \n\n20 + x = total number of Jawbreakers \n\n5. We know that 8 Jawbreakers come in a package, so we can figure out how many packages Sarah had to start with by dividing x by 8: \n\nx / 8 = number of packages \n\n6. We also know that Sarah has 4 Jawbreakers left, so we can set up another equation: \n\n4 = x % 8 (read as 'x mod 8') \n\nThe % (mod) symbol gives us the remainder when x is divided by 8. So this equation says that Sarah has 4 Jawbreakers left over after dividing the total number she had by 8. \n\n7. We can use these two equations to solve for x: \n\nx / 8 = number of packages \n\nx % 8 = 4 \n\nOne way to do this is to start by guessing a number of packages that Sarah had to start with (let's say 4): \n\n4 * 8 = 32 (total number of Jawbreakers) \n\n32 % 8 = 0 (no remainder, so this guess is incorrect) \n\nLet's try again: \n\n5 * 8 = 40 \n\n40 % 8 = 0 (wrong again) \n\n6 * 8 = 48 \n\n48 % 8 = 0 (still not right) \n\n7 * 8 = 56 \n\n56 % 8 = 0 (nope) \n\n8 * 8 = 64 \n\n64 % 8 = 0 (getting closer, but not there yet) \n\n9 * 8 = 72 \n\n72 % 8 = 0 (still no remainder, so Sarah must have had more than 72 Jawbreakers to start with) \n\n10 * 8 = 80 \n\n80 % 8 = 0 (bingo!) \n\nSo Sarah must have started with 80 Jawbreakers. \n\n11.
