The distance traveled is 300 feet, and the time is 10 minutes. So we can set up the equation: \n\n300 = (b - c) * 10 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n30 = b - c \n\nWhen rowing downstream, the effective speed of the boat is faster, since it's going with the current. The distance traveled is 350 feet, and the time is 7 minutes. So we can set up the equation: \n\n350 = (b + c) * 7 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n50 = b + c \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for 'b' and 'c' by adding the two equations together: \n\n30 + 50 = 2b \n\n80 = 2b \n\nb = 40 \n\nSo the speed of the boat in still water is 40 feet per minute. Now we can use one of the earlier equations to solve for the speed of the current: \n\n30 = b - c \n\n30 = 40 - c \n\nc = 10 \n\nSo the speed of the current is 10 feet per minute."}

We know that Ruffy's age is 3/4 Orlie's age, so we can replace 'Ruffy's age' with 3/4 x in the second equation (where x = Orlie's current age).\n\nFour years ago, Ruffy's age was 1 year more than half old as Orlie:\n(Ruffy's age - 4) = (1/2)(Orlie's age - 4) + 1\n\nSubstitute 3/4 x for Ruffy's age:\n(3/4 x - 4) = (1/2)(x - 4) + 1 \n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n(3/4 x - 4) = (1/2 x - 2) + 1\n3/4 x - 4 = 1/2 x - 1\n1/4 x = 3\nx = 12\n\nSo Orlie is currently 12 years old.

Let's start with the value of the peanuts:\n\nvalue of 1 bag of peanuts = (x - 0.30) dollars\n\nBut we need an equal amount of peanuts and cashews for each bag of the mixture, so the value of 1 bag of cashews is:\n\nvalue of 1 bag of cashews = x dollars\n\nThe total cost of one bag of the mixture is the sum of the value of one bag of peanuts and one bag of cashews:\n\ncost of 1 bag of mixture = (x - 0.30) + x\ncost of 1 bag of mixture = 2x - 0.30 dollars\n\nIf we're making 40 bags of the mixture, the total revenue is:\n\nrevenue = 40 x 1.05 = 42 dollars\n\nThe total cost is:\n\ncost = 40 x (2x - 0.30) = 80x - 12 dollars\n\nWe know that revenue = cost, so:\n\n42 = 80x - 12\n\nSolving for x:\n\n80x = 42 + 12\n80x = 54\nx = 0.675\n\nTherefore, a bag of cashews is worth 0.675 dollars or 67.5 cents."}

Let's use the first one:\n\n- 9(2) + 2p = 28\n- 18 + 2p = 28\n- 2p = 10\n- p = 5\n\nSo the hourly rate for premium service is $5."}

At that time, Bill was as old as Ben is now. Let's call their ages at that time B' and N':\n\nB' = N\n\nAnd we also know that at that same point in the past, Bill was twice as old as Ben was. In other words:\n\nB' = 2(N' - X)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (B and N). We can use substitution to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for B:\n\nB = 91 - N\n\nWe can then substitute this expression for B into the second equation, replacing B' with 91 - N since B' = N at that time:\n\n91 - N = 2(N' - X)\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n91 - N = 2N' - 2X\n\nWe still have two unknowns (N and N'), but we know that B' = N, so we can substitute N for B' in the second equation:\n\n91 - N = 2(N - X)\n\nExpanding this expression:\n\n91 - N = 2N - 2X\n\nSimplifying:\n\n3N = 91 + 2X\n\nNow we have one equation with one variable. We can solve for N:\n\nN = (91 + 2X) / 3\n\nWe don't know the value of X yet, but we know that N must be an integer (since we're dealing with ages). Let's try some values of X and see if we get an integer value for N.\n\nIf X = 0, then N = 91/3, which is not an integer. If X = 1, then N = 93/3, which is also not an integer.

This means that if we add 5 to each of their ages and add them together, we get 28. So we can write: (L + 5) + (J + 5) = 28.\n\nNow we can use these equations to solve for L. We'll start by substituting the first equation into the second equation, since we want to solve for L:\n\n(L + 5) + (J + 5) = 28\nSubstitute L = 3 + 2J:\n(3 + 2J + 5) + (J + 5) = 28\nSimplify:\n3J + 13 = 28 - 10\n3J + 13 = 18\n3J = 5\nJ = 5/3\n\nSo Jane's current age is 5/3.

So we must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet's go back to the first equation we set up, L = 3 + 2J. We can see that if J is a whole number, then 2J must be even. Adding 3 to an even number will always give us an odd number, so L must be odd. But we're looking for two whole numbers that add up to 28 in five years, so they both need to be either even or odd (since odd + odd = even, and even + even = even).\n\nThis means that there's no solution to the problem as stated.

If the profit on the 12 % bonds was $ 885 more than the profit on the 5 % bonds , how much did Mr. Graham invest in the 5 % bonds ?", "response": "\n\nLet's start by setting up some equations.\n\nLet x be the amount invested in 5% bonds and y be the amount invested in 12% bonds.\n\nWe know that x + y = 18000, since the total amount invested is $18,000.\n\nWe also know that the profit on the 12% bonds was $885 more than the profit on the 5% bonds. Let's call the profit on the 5% bonds P5 and the profit on the 12% bonds P12. Then we have:\n\nP12 = P5 + 885\n\nNow we can use the formulas for calculating profit:\n\nP5 = 0.05x\nP12 = 0.12y\n\nSubstituting these into the equation above, we get:\n\n0.12y = 0.05x + 885\n\nWe can now use the first equation (x + y = 18000) to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 18000 - x\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n0.12(18000 - x) = 0.05x + 885\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\n2160 - 0.12x = 0.05x + 885\n0.17x = 1275\nx = 7500\n\nTherefore, Mr. Graham invested $7,500 in the 5% bonds. To find the amount invested in the 12% bonds, we can use the equation y = 18000 - x:\n\ny = 18000 - 7500 = 10500\n\nSo, he invested $7,500 in the 5% bonds and $10,500 in the 12% bonds."}

Let's use the $9 coffee beans as an example:\n\nThe $9 coffee beans cost $9 per pound, and we are using x pounds of them in the mixture, so the total value of the $9 coffee beans in the mixture will be:\n\n9x\n\nSimilarly, the total value of the $12 coffee beans in the mixture will be:\n\n12y\n\nThe total value of both types of beans together in the mixture will be the sum of these values, so we can write the equation:\n\n9x + 12y = 1125\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables.

Then 5 years ago, Mary's age would have been M-5, and her Son's age would have been S-5. So we can write:\n\nM-5 = 5(S-5)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nM-5 = 5S - 25\n\nM = 5S - 20 \u27a1\ufe0f Equation 1\n\n2. '3 years hence her age will be 8 less than three times the corresponding age of her Son'\n\nIn 3 years, Mary's age will be M+3, and her Son's age will be S+3.

How many minutes per week does she spend on weight training ?", "response": "\n\nWe can start the problem by first finding the total ratio of time spent on aerobics to weight training, which is 3+2 = 5.\n\nTo find how many minutes per week Kay spends on aerobics, we can use the proportion:\n\naerobics time / total time = aerobics ratio / total ratio\n\nLet x be the time spent on aerobics in minutes. Then we can write:\n\nx / 250 = 3 / 5\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5x = 750\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nx = 150\n\nTherefore, Kay spends 150 minutes per week on aerobics.\n\nTo find how many minutes per week she spends on weight training, we can use the same approach:\n\nweight training time / total time = weight training ratio / total ratio\n\nLet y be the time spent on weight training in minutes. Then we can write:\n\ny / 250 = 2 / 5\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5y = 500\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\ny = 100\n\nTherefore, Kay spends 100 minutes per week on weight training."}

What is the child 's running speed on a still sidewalk , and what is the speed of the moving sidewalk ?", "response": "\n\nLet's call the child's running speed on a still sidewalk 'x' and the speed of the moving sidewalk 'y'.\n\nWhen the child runs in the direction of the sidewalk's motion, their effective speed is the sum of their running speed and the speed of the sidewalk:\n\neffective speed = x + y\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nto write an equation for the distance the child covers in this case:\n\n372 = (x+y) \u00d7 4\n\nSimilarly, when the child runs in the opposite direction of the sidewalk's motion, their effective speed is the difference between their running speed and the speed of the sidewalk:\n\neffective speed = x - y\n\nAnd the equation for the distance covered is:\n\n165 = (x-y) \u00d7 3\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (x and y), which we can solve simultaneously. One way to do this is to rearrange each equation to isolate one of the variables, and then substitute that expression into the other equation:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx + y = 372/4\n\nx + y = 93\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\nx - y = 165/3\n\nx - y = 55\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\nx + y = 93\n\nx - y = 55\n\nWe can solve for one variable in terms of the other by adding or subtracting the equations. In this case, if we add them, we get:\n\n2x = 148\n\nx = 74\n\nSo the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 74 meters per minute. To find the speed of the moving sidewalk, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations. Let's use the first one:\n\nx + y = 93\n\n74 + y = 93\n\ny = 19\n\nSo the speed of the moving sidewalk is 19 meters per minute. \n\nTherefore, the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 74 meters per minute, and the speed of the moving sidewalk is 19 meters per minute."}

So, we can write:\n\n16 miles = (b + c) x (20/60) hours \n\nNote that we convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n16 = (1/3)(b + c)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\n\n48 = b + c \n\nNow let's look at when the boat is going back upstream. This time, its speed relative to the shore is b - c (because the current is now working against it). So:\n\n16 miles = (b - c) x (30/60) hours \n\nSimplifying:\n\n16 = (1/2)(b - c)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n32 = b - c \n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n48 = b + c \n32 = b - c \n\nAdding these equations, we eliminate c:\n\n80 = 2b \n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nb = 40 \n\nSo the speed of the boat in still water is 40 mph. \n\nNow we can use either of the two equations we wrote earlier to find the speed of the current.

A drainpipe can empty the full content of the tank in 20 hours . With all the three pipes open , how long will it take to fill the tank ?", "response": "\n\nLet's first calculate the rates at which each pipe fills or empties the tank:\n\n- The first pipe fills 1/5 of the tank per hour (since it takes 5 hours to fill the whole tank).\n- The second pipe fills 1/4 of the tank per hour.\n- The drainpipe empties 1/20 of the tank per hour.\n\nNow we can use the fact that the rates add when the pipes work together. Let's call X the time (in hours) it takes to fill the tank with all three pipes open. Then:\n\n- In X hours, the first pipe fills X/5 of the tank.\n- In X hours, the second pipe fills X/4 of the tank.\n- In X hours, the drainpipe empties X/20 of the tank.\n\nWe want the net effect of all three pipes to be filling the tank, so the sum of the rates must be positive:\n\nX/5 + X/4 - X/20 > 0\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n4X + 5X - X > 0\n\n8X > 0\n\nX > 0\n\nTherefore, the time X is positive, which makes sense: the tank will eventually fill up as long as the pipes are working.\n\nNow we can solve for X:\n\n8X > 0       (multiplying by 20 to get rid of the fractions)\n\n160X > 0\n\nX > 0       (dividing by 160)\n\nSo the tank will fill up in more than 0 hours, which is obvious. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nX = 20 / (1/5 + 1/4 - 1/20)\n\nX = 20 / (4/20 + 5/20 - 1/20)\n\nX = 20 / 8/20\n\nX = 2.5 hours\n\nTherefore, with all three pipes open, it will take 2.5 hours to fill the tank."}

This means that the total cost of the mix is:\n\n18 * 2.30 = $41.40\n\nWe can write another equation for the total cost of the coffee based on the cost per pound of each kind:\n\n2.15x + 2.45y = total cost of coffee\n\nWe want to find x and y that satisfy both equations. To do so, we can use substitution. Rearranging the first equation, we have:\n\nx = 18 - y\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n2.15(18 - y) + 2.45y = 41.40\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n38.7 - 0.3y = 41.40\n\nSubtracting 38.7 from both sides:\n\n-0.3y = 2.7\n\nDividing by -0.3:\n\ny = 9\n\nSo the grocer should use 9 pounds of the second kind of coffee.

So, we have:\n\nAmount of vinegar in the first brand = 0.08x\nAmount of vinegar in the second brand = 0.13(320-x)\n\nTo make 320 milliliters of 11% vinegar dressing, we need to have:\n\n0.11(320) = 0.08x + 0.13(320-x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n35.2 = 0.03x + 41.6 - 0.13x\n\n-6.4 = -0.10x\n\nx = 64\n\nTherefore, the chef should use 64 milliliters of the first brand and 320-64 = 256 milliliters of the second brand to make 320 milliliters of 11% vinegar dressing."}

If mary can shovel the same driveway in 20 minutes , how long will it take them , to the nearest minute , to shove the driveway if they work together ?", "response": "\n\n\nOne common method to solve this type of problem is to use the formula:\n\ntime = total work / work rate\n\nwhere 'total work' is the amount of work required to shovel the driveway, and 'work rate' is the rate of work (in units of driveways per minute) of each person. To use this formula, we need to first find the total work and the work rate for each person and for both of them together.\n\nThe total work is simply one driveway, which we denote by '1 D'. We can assume that both Joan and Mary have constant work rates throughout the task, so we can express their work rates as:\n\nJoan's work rate: 1 D / 50 min = 0.02 D/min\nMary's work rate: 1 D / 20 min = 0.05 D/min\n\nTo find their work rate together, we add their individual work rates:\n\nCombined work rate: 0.02 D/min + 0.05 D/min = 0.07 D/min\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\ntime = total work / work rate\ntime = 1 D / 0.07 D/min \u2248 14.3 min\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 14.3 minutes (to the nearest minute) for Joan and Mary to shovel the driveway together."}

This means that the amount of water that the larger pipe can fill in 4 hours plus the amount of water that the smaller pipe can fill in 9 hours is equal to half of the pool: \n\n4r + 9s = 1/2 \n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which means we can solve for both 'r' and 's'. \n\nFirst, let's simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 2: \n\n8r + 18s = 1 \n\nNow we can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Solving for 'r', we get: \n\nr = 1/12 - s \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for 'r' into the second equation: \n\n4(1/12 - s) + 9s = 1/2 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1/3 - 4s + 9s = 1/2 \n\n5s = 1/6 \n\ns = 1/30 \n\nNow that we know that the rate of the smaller pipe is 1/30 of the pool per hour, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to solve for 'r': \n\nr + 1/30 = 1/12 \n\nr = 1/12 - 1/30 = 1/20 \n\nSo we have determined that the pipe with the larger diameter can fill the pool at a rate of 1/20 of the pool per hour and the pipe with the smaller diameter can fill the pool at a rate of 1/30 of the pool per hour. \n\nFinally, we can use these rates to determine how long each pipe would take to fill the pool separately. \n\nLet's call the time it takes for the larger pipe to fill the pool 't1' and the time it takes for the smaller pipe to fill the pool 't2'. Using the formula Rate x Time = Amount of Work, we can set up the following equations: \n\n1/20 x t1 = 1 (the entire pool) \n\n1/30 x t2 = 1 (the entire pool) \n\nSolving for 't1' and 't2', we get: \n\nt1 = 20 hours \n\nt2 = 30 hours \n\nTherefore, the pipe with the larger diameter would take 20 hours to fill the pool on its own while the pipe with the smaller diameter would take 30 hours to fill the pool on its own."}

Let's call x the volume of 60% solution (in mL) needed, and y the volume of 30% solution (also in mL) needed. We can then set up two equations based on the requirements of the problem:\n\nx + y = 630      (total volume of mixture)\n0.6x + 0.3y = 0.5(630)   (total amount of acid in mixture)\n\nThe first equation simply states that the volumes of the two solutions need to add up to 630 mL.

We can simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 10:\n\n6x + 3y = 3150\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve by substitution or elimination.

A bott of wine without a cork costs $ 2.00 more than the cork . What is the price of the cork ?", "response": "\n\nLet's call the price of the cork 'x'. \n\nWe know that the bottle of wine with cork costs $2.10, so: \n\nprice of wine + price of cork = $2.10 \n\nWe also know that the bottle of wine without cork costs $2.00 more than the cork. So: \n\nprice of wine + price of corkless = price of cork + $2.00 \n\nNow we can use these two equations to solve for 'x', the price of the cork. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can rearrange it to solve for the price of wine: \n\nprice of wine = $2.10 - price of cork \n\nWe can substitute this expression for 'price of wine' into the second equation: \n\n$2.10 - price of cork + price of corkless = price of cork + $2.00 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n$0.10 + price of corkless = $2.00 + 2*price of cork \n\nNow we can solve for 'x': \n\n$0.10 + price of corkless - $2.00 = 2*price of cork \n\n-$1.90 + price of corkless = 2*x \n\nx = (-$1.90 + price of corkless) / 2 \n\nWe don't know the price of the corkless bottle, but we don't need to. We just need to know that it costs $2.00 more than the cork. So we can write: \n\nprice of corkless = x + $2.00 \n\nNow we substitute this expression into our equation for 'x' that we just found: \n\nx = (-$1.90 + x + $2.00) / 2 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nx = $0.05 \n\nSo the price of the cork is $0.05."}

He uses 500 milliliters less of Solution A than Solution B. Solution A is 16 % alcohol and Solution B is 10 % alcohol . How many milliliters of Solution A does he use , if the resulting mixture has 76 milliliters of pure alcohol ?", "response": "\n\nLet's first find how much pure alcohol each solution contains:\n\n- Solution A contains 16% alcohol, which means it has 0.16 * V_A milliliters of pure alcohol, where V_A is the volume of Solution A in milliliters.\n- Solution B contains 10% alcohol, which means it has 0.1 * V_B milliliters of pure alcohol, where V_B is the volume of Solution B in milliliters.\n\nWe know that Chang uses 500 milliliters less of Solution A than Solution B: V_A = V_B - 500. \n\nWe also know that the resulting mixture has 76 milliliters of pure alcohol. Let's call the total volume of the mixture V_m: \n\n- The amount of pure alcohol from Solution A in the mixture is 0.16 * V_A.\n- The amount of pure alcohol from Solution B in the mixture is 0.1 * V_B.\n- So the total amount of pure alcohol in the mixture is: \n\n0.16 * V_A + 0.1 * V_B = 0.76 * V_m \n\nNow we can substitute V_A = V_B - 500 into the equation and simplify:\n\n0.16 * (V_B - 500) + 0.1 * V_B = 0.76 * V_m \n\n0.26 * V_B - 80 = 0.76 * V_m \n\nWe still have two unknowns, so let's see if we can get another equation. The total volume of the mixture is the sum of volumes from Solution A and Solution B: \n\nV_m = V_A + V_B\n\nSubstituting V_A = V_B - 500:\n\nV_m = V_B - 500 + V_B \n\nV_m = 2 * V_B - 500 \n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns: \n\n0.26 * V_B - 80 = 0.76 * (2 * V_B - 500)\n\n0.26 * V_B - 80 = 1.52 * V_B - 380 \n\n1.26 * V_B = 300 \n\nV_B = 238.1 \n\nSo Chang used about 238 milliliters of Solution B. Using the equation V_A = V_B - 500, we find that he used about 238 - 500 =  -262 milliliters of Solution A. \n\nWait a minute, negative volume? That doesn't make sense! What's going on here?\n\nThe negative volume means that Solution A was overused, beyond what was actually available. This suggests that the amount of pure alcohol in Solution B alone (10% of 238.1 mL) is not enough to yield a mixture of 76 mL pure alcohol. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution to this problem as stated. Chang would need to add more alcohol, either by using more of Solution A, or by using a third solution with a higher alcohol content."}
