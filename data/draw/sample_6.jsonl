That means his time for each direction is equal. Let's call that time 't'. \n\nSo we can set up two equations: \n\n12 = (15 + c) * t \n\n9 = (15 - c) * t \n\nSimplifying the first equation, we get: \n\n12 = 15t + ct \n\nAnd simplifying the second equation, we get: \n\n9 = 15t - ct \n\nNow we can solve for 't' in terms of 'c' by adding these two equations: \n\n21 = 30t \n\nt = 21/30 \n\nt = 0.7 hours \n\nNow we can use either of the two original equations to solve for 'c'. Let's use the second one: \n\n9 = (15 - c) * 0.7 \n\nDividing both sides by 0.7: \n\n12.86 = 15 - c \n\nSubtracting 15 from both sides: \n\n-2.14 = -c \n\nSo: \n\nc = 2.14 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 2.14 miles per hour.", "prompt_tokens": 63, "completion_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 410}

So the distance traveled on the first leg is:\n\ndistance 1 = rate 1 x time 1\ndistance 1 = 5 kph x t1\n\nFor the second leg of the journey, after resting for 2 hours, the boy traveled at a rate of 3 kph for some unknown amount of time (we'll call this t2).

Figure the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the current of the river .", "response": "Let's call the speed of the boat in still water 'b' and the speed of the current 'c'. \n\nWhen going downriver (with the current), the boat's speed is boosted by the speed of the current, so its effective speed is b + c. Similarly, when going upstream (against the current), the boat's effective speed is b - c. \n\nWe can set up two equations based on this information: \n\n18 = (b + c) x 2 (distance = rate x time) \n\n18 = (b - c) x 3 \n\nSimplifying the first equation: \n\n9b + 9c = 18 \n\nDividing by 9: \n\nb + c = 2 \n\nSimplifying the second equation: \n\n9b - 9c = 18 \n\nDividing by 9: \n\nb - c = 2 \n\nNow we have two equations that we can solve simultaneously. We can do this by adding the equations together, which eliminates the 'c' term: \n\n2b = 4 \n\nDividing by 2: \n\nb = 2 \n\nSo the speed of the boat in still water is 2 km/h. \n\nNow we can use either of the original equations to solve for the speed of the current. Let's use the first one: \n\n18 = (2 + c) x 2 \n\n9 = 2 + c \n\nSubtracting 2: \n\nc = 7 \n\nSo the speed of the current is 7 km/h. \n\nTo check our work, we can make sure that the second equation also holds true: \n\n18 = (2 - 7) x 3 \n\n18 = -5 x 3 \n\n18 = -15 \n\nOops! That doesn't work. What went wrong? \n\nIt turns out that our assumption about the boat always traveling at a constant speed in the river is not quite accurate. When the boat is going upstream, it has to fight the current, which slows it down. So its speed relative to the river is slower than when it's going downstream. \n\nTo account for this, we need to use a slightly different approach. Let's call the boat's speed upstream 'bu' and its speed downstream 'bd'. Then we can set up two new equations: \n\n18 = bu x 3 \n\n18 = bd x 2 \n\nWe don't know what bu and bd are yet, but we can use the fact that the total distance traveled is the same in both cases: \n\n18 = bu x 3 = bd x 2 \n\nDividing by 6: \n\n3 = bu/2 = bd/3 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, then substitute into the other equation. Let's solve for bd in terms of bu: \n\n3 = bd/3 \n\n9 = bd \n\nSubstituting into the other equation: \n\n2bu/3 = 9 \n\nMultiplying by 3/2: \n\nbu = 13.5 \n\nNow we can use either equation to solve for bd: \n\nbd = 18/2 = 9 \n\nSo the boat's speed downstream is 9 km/h and its speed upstream is 13.5 km/h. \n\nTo find the speed of the current, we take the average of the two speeds: \n\nc = (bd - bu)/2 = (9 - 13.5)/2 = -2.25 \n\nWait, a negative speed of the current? That doesn't make sense! \n\nThis negative value actually tells us that our assumption about the direction of the current was wrong. In reality, the current must have been going upstream (against the boat) on both legs of the journey. If we switch the direction of the current in our equations, we get: \n\n3 = bu/2 - c \n\n2 = bd/3 + c \n\nSubstituting bu and bd: \n\n3 = 13.5/2 - c \n\n2 = 9/3 + c \n\nSimplifying: \n\nc = 1.5 \n\nSo the speed of the current is 1.5 km/h, and the boat's speed in still water is still 2 km/h. \n\nPhew!
