On the way back to school she averaged 30 mph . If the total driving time was 1.5 hours , how long did it take her to drive each way .", "response": "Let's call the time it took Danielle to drive from school to home 't1' and the time it took her to drive from home to school 't2'. We know that:\n\n- Her average speed from school to home was 20 mph, so the distance from school to home (let's call it 'd1') is equal to 20t1.\n- Her average speed from home to school was 30 mph, so the distance from home to school (let's call it 'd2') is equal to 30t2.\n- The total driving time was 1.5 hours, so t1 + t2 = 1.5.\n\nWe want to find t1 and t2, so we need another equation. We can use the fact that the total distance Danielle drove was the same whether she was driving from school to home or from home to school. In other words:\n\nd1 + d2 = total distance\n\nWe don't know the total distance, but we do know that d1 = 20t1 and d2 = 30t2. So we can substitute those expressions in:\n\n20t1 + 30t2 = total distance\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nt1 + t2 = 1.5\n20t1 + 30t2 = total distance\n\nWe have two equations with two variables (t1 and t2), so we can solve for them. Let's start by solving the first equation for t2:\n\nt2 = 1.5 - t1\n\nNow we can substitute that expression in the second equation:\n\n20t1 + 30(1.5 - t1) = total distance\n\nSimplifying:\n\n20t1 + 45 - 30t1 = total distance\n\n-10t1 + 45 = total distance\n\nWe still don't know the total distance, but we don't need to in order to find t1 and t2. We can use the fact that the total driving time was 1.5 hours:\n\nt1 + t2 = 1.5\n\nSubstituting t2 = 1.5 - t1:\n\nt1 + (1.5 - t1) = 1.5\n\nSimplifying:\n\n1.5 = 1.5\n\nThis equation is always true, so we can't use it to find t1 and t2. However, we can use it to check our answers later.\n\nLet's go back to the equation we had before:\n\n-10t1 + 45 = total distance\n\nWe need to find t1 and t2, so we need to find the total distance. To do that, we could use the fact that the total distance is equal to d1 + d2, and we know that d1 = 20t1 and d2 = 30t2. So:\n\ntotal distance = 20t1 + 30t2\n\nSubstituting t2 = 1.5 - t1:\n\ntotal distance = 20t1 + 30(1.5 - t1)\n\nSimplifying:\n\ntotal distance = 45 - 10t1\n\nNow we have an expression for the total distance in terms of t1. We can substitute this in the equation we had before:\n\n-10t1 + 45 = 45 - 10t1\n\nThis equation is also always true, so we haven't made any mistakes.\n\nWe still don't know t1 and t2, but we know that:\n\n- t1 + t2 = 1.5 (equation 1)\n- total distance = 45 - 10t1 (equation 2)\n\nWe can use equation 1 to solve for t2:\n\nt2 = 1.5 - t1\n\nSubstituting this in equation 2:\n\ntotal distance = 45 - 10t1 = 20t1 + 30(1.5 - t1)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n45 - 10t1 = 20t1 + 45 - 30t1\n\n10t1 = 10\n\nt1 = 1\n\nSo it took Danielle 1 hour to drive from school to home. We can use equation 1 to find t2:\n\nt1 + t2 = 1.5\n\n1 + t2 = 1.5\n\nt2 = 0.5\n\nSo it took Danielle 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) to drive from home to school.\n\nWe can check that these answers are correct by verifying that t1 + t2 = 1.5. We found t1 = 1 and t2 = 0.5, so:\n\nt1 + t2 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5\n\nThis matches the total driving time, so our answers are correct.\n\nTherefore, it took Danielle 1 hour to drive from school to home and 0.5 hours to drive from home to school.", "prompt_tokens": 62, "completion_tokens": 1025, "total_tokens": 1087}

Unfortunately , he leaves the drain open which will drain the pool in 8 hours . How long will it take to fill the pool ?", "response": "Let's first find the fraction of the pool that the pump and the garden hose can fill in one hour:\n\n- The pump can fill 1/6 of the pool in one hour since it takes 6 hours to fill the entire pool.\n- The garden hose can fill 1/10 of the pool in one hour since it takes 10 hours to fill the entire pool.\n- Together, the pump and the garden hose can fill 1/6 + 1/10 = 4/15 of the pool in one hour.\n\nNow let's find out how long it takes to fill the pool with both the pump and the garden hose running while the drain is open. We can use the following formula:\n\ntime = amount of work \u00f7 rate of work\n\nIn this case, the 'amount of work' is filling the whole pool, which we can represent as 1. The 'rate of work' is 4/15, since that's how much of the pool can be filled in one hour with both the pump and the garden hose working together. The tricky part is that the drain is open, so the 'amount of work' being undone every hour is also 1/8, which is how much of the pool will drain in one hour.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\ntime = 1 \u00f7 (4/15 - 1/8)\n\ntime = 1 \u00f7 (17/120)\n\ntime = 120/17\n\ntime \u2248 7.06 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take about 7.06 hours to fill the pool with both the pump and the garden hose running while the drain is open.", "prompt_tokens": 90, "completion_tokens": 337, "total_tokens": 427}

We'll let x be the amount of pure copper needed (in grams) and y be the amount of British sterling silver needed (also in grams). \n\nWe know that the total amount of alloy needed is 200 grams: \n\nx + y = 200 \n\nWe also know that the final alloy should be 10% copper by weight, which means that the weight of copper in the final alloy is 0.1 times the total weight: \n\n0.1(200) = 20 \n\nSo, we need to end up with 20 grams of pure copper in the final alloy. \n\nNow we can use the fact that British sterling silver is 7.5% copper by weight to set up another equation.
