So, a bag of the mixture will cost 2y dollars.\n\nNow we can use the information given in the problem to set up some equations and solve for the unknowns. First, we know that the cost of a bag of the mixture is 1.05 dollars, so:\n\n2y = 1.05\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 0.525\n\nNext, we can use the fact that there are 40 bags of the mixture to find the total amount of cashews and peanuts used:\n\n40 bags x 2 (since each bag contains 1 bag of cashews and 1 bag of peanuts) = 80 bags of nuts\n\nSince each bag contains an equal amount of cashews and peanuts, we can say that there are 40 bags of cashews and 40 bags of peanuts. The total cost of the cashews used is therefore:\n\n40 bags x y dollars per bag = 40y = 21 dollars\n\nAnd the total cost of the peanuts used is:\n\n40 bags x (y - 0.30) dollars per bag = 40(y - 0.30) = 18 dollars\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the total cost of the nuts used is equal to the cost of the mixture:\n\n21 + 18 = 2y x 40\n\n39 = 84y\n\n39 = 44.10x\n\nx = 0.885\n\nTherefore, a bag of cashews is worth $0.885.", "prompt_tokens": 70, "completion_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 476}

First, let's isolate one of the variables in one of the equations. We can do this by multiplying the entire equation by a number that will make one of the terms cancel out. For example, if we multiply the first equation by -2, we can cancel out the 3w term:\n\n-6w - 6r = -35.40\n2w + 3r = 15.54\n\nNow we can add these two equations together to eliminate the 'w' term:\n\n-4w - 3r = -19.86\n\nNext, we can isolate one of the variables in this new equation. Let's solve for 'r' by adding 4w to both sides:\n\n-3r = 4w - 19.86\n\nFinally, we can solve for 'r' by dividing both sides by -3:\n\nr = (19.86 - 4w) / -3\n\nNow we can plug this expression for 'r' into one of our original equations to solve for 'w'. Let's use the second equation:\n\n2w + 3r = 15.54\n\nSubstituting our expression for 'r', we get:\n\n2w + 3[(19.86 - 4w) / -3] = 15.54\n\nMultiplying both sides by -3 to cancel out the fraction, we get:\n\n-6w + (19.86 - 4w) = -46.62\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-10w = -66.48\n\nDividing both sides by -10, we get:\n\nw = 6.648\n\nSo a ride on the water slide costs $6.65 (rounded to the nearest cent). To find the cost of a ride on the roller coaster, we can substitute this value for 'w' into our expression for 'r':\n\nr = (19.86 - 4w) / -3\nr = (19.86 - 4(6.648)) / -3\nr = 4.914\n\nSo a ride on the roller coaster costs $4.91 (rounded to the nearest cent).", "prompt_tokens": 81, "completion_tokens": 521, "total_tokens": 602}

What is the km per hour for this ship if there is no speed in this stream ? What is this stream 's km per hour ?", "response": "Let's first find the speed of the ship without the stream. We know that distance = speed x time, so the ship traveled 36 km in 5 hours (3 hours going up, 2 hours going down). Therefore, its speed without the stream is:\n\nspeed = distance / time\nspeed = 36 km / 5 hours\nspeed = 7.2 km/hour\n\nNow we can find the speed of the stream itself by using the fact that the ship's speed relative to the water is different when going up vs. down the stream. Specifically, the difference between these speeds is twice the speed of the stream. Let's call the speed of the stream 's'. Then:\n\nship speed going up = 7.2 km/hour - s\nship speed going down = 7.2 km/hour + s\n\nWe know that these speeds correspond to distances of 36 km each (since the ship went up and down the same distance). So we can set up two equations and solve for the speed of the stream:\n\n36 km = (7.2 km/hour - s) x 3 hours\n36 km = (7.2 km/hour + s) x 2 hours\n\nSolving for s in the first equation gives:\n\ns = 7.2 km/hour - 12 km/hour\ns = -4.8 km/hour\n\nThis negative value for the stream speed means that the stream was flowing in the opposite direction of the ship's travel. If we interpret 'upstream' as meaning against the direction of the stream flow, then we would say that the stream was flowing at a speed of 4.8 km/hour (assuming constant flow during the ship's journey).", "prompt_tokens": 69, "completion_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 424}

What is the child 's running speed on a still sidewalk , and what is the speed of the moving sidewalk ?", "response": "Let's call the child's running speed 'r' and the speed of the moving sidewalk 's'. We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nFirst, let's consider the child running in the direction of the sidewalk's motion. The child is essentially running on a still sidewalk and being carried forward by the moving sidewalk at a speed of 's'. So the child's effective speed in this direction is 'r + s'. The distance covered is 372 meters and the time taken is 4 minutes. So we can write:\n\n372 = (r + s) \u00d7 4\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nr + s = 93\n\nNow let's consider the child running in the opposite direction of the sidewalk's motion. In this case, the child is essentially running against the motion of the sidewalk, so their effective speed in this direction is 'r - s'. The distance covered is 165 meters and the time taken is 3 minutes. So we can write:\n\n165 = (r - s) \u00d7 3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nr - s = 55\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using any method of our choice. For simplicity, we can add the two equations to eliminate 's':\n\n(r + s) + (r - s) = 93 + 55\n\n2r = 148\n\nr = 74\n\nSo the child's running speed on a still sidewalk is 74 meters per minute.

If we think about it, we can see that we made a mistake when we substituted y = 10 - x into the first equation. This works when we're solving for y, but not when we're solving for x. \n\nLet's go back to the original two equations: \n\n1.3x + 2y = 1.72(10) \n\nx + y = 10 \n\nThen let's solve for y in terms of x: \n\ny = 10 - x \n\nNow substitute this into the first equation: \n\n1.3x + 2(10 - x) = 17.2 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n1.3x + 20 - 2x = 17.2 \n\n-0.7x = -2.8 \n\nx = 4 \n\nFinally! A positive value for x. \n\nNow we can use the second equation to solve for y: \n\n4 + y = 10 \n\ny = 6 \n\nSo we need 4 boxes of red beads and 6 boxes of yellow beads to make 10 boxes of beads at a cost of $1.72 per box.", "prompt_tokens": 68, "completion_tokens": 567, "total_tokens": 635}
