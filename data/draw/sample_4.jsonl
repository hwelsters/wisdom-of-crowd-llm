First, we can multiply equation 1 by 2 and subtract it from equation 2 to eliminate y:\n\n- 70x + 90y = 40,000\n- 80x + 70y = 40,000\n\nSubtracting equation 1 multiplied by 2 from equation 2 gives:\n\n10x = 0\n\nTherefore, x = 0. We can now substitute x = 0 into equation 1 to solve for y:\n\n- 40(0) + 35y = 20,000\n- y = 571.43\n\nSo the smaller shovel can move 571.43 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone.\n\nNow we can use either equation 1 or 2 to solve for x. Let's use equation 1:\n\n- 40x + 35(571.43) = 20,000\n- 40x = 20,000 - 20,000\n- x = 0\n\nSo the larger shovel can move 0 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone.\n\nThis means that the smaller shovel is the only one that can move earth alone. \n\nAnswer: The smaller shovel can move 571.43 cubic meters of earth in one hour working alone. The larger shovel cannot move any earth alone.", "prompt_tokens": 88, "completion_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 477}

On the first part of the trip they crossed a lake in a canoe paddling at 12 km/h . For the rest of the trip , they hiked on a scenic trail . If their average walking speed was 5 km/h , how far did they walk ?", "response": "Let's start by finding out how long it took the family to canoe across the lake. We know they traveled 43.25 km in 5.5 hours, so their overall average speed was:\n\n43.25 km \u00f7 5.5 hours = 7.86 km/h\n\nWe also know they paddled at 12 km/h during the first part of the trip. Let's call the time they spent paddling 't', and the distance they traveled across the lake 'd'. We can set up an equation:\n\nd/12 + (5.5 - t)/5 = 43.25/7.86\n\nSimplifying and solving for t:\n\nd/12 + 1.1 - t/5 = 5.5\nd/12 - t/5 = 4.4\n5d - 60t = 264    (multiplied by 60 to eliminate fractions)\nd = (264 + 60t)/5\n\nNow we need another equation to relate the distance the family walked to the time they spent hiking. They spent (5.5 - t) hours hiking at 5 km/h, so the distance they walked can be expressed as:\n\ndistance walked = 5 km/h \u00d7 (5.5 - t)\n\nWe want to solve for the distance they walked, so we need to eliminate t from these equations. We can substitute the expression we found for d into the second equation:\n\ndistance walked = 5 km/h \u00d7 (5.5 - t) = 5 km/h \u00d7 (5.5 - [(264 + 60t)/5]/5\n= 27.5 km - 12t\n\nNow we can solve for t by plugging in the value we found earlier for d:\n\n5d - 60t = 264\n5[(264 + 60t)/5] - 60t = 264\n264 + 60t - 60t = 264/5\n264t = 1056\nt = 4 hours\n\nSo the family spent 4 hours paddling across the lake, and 5.5 - 4 = 1.5 hours hiking. Plugging this into the equation we found for the distance they walked:\n\ndistance walked = 27.5 km - 12t = 27.5 km - 12(4) = 27.5 km - 48 km\n= -20.5 km\n\nThis doesn't make sense - the distance they walked should be positive! What went wrong? We made a mistake when we assumed that the family's average speed was constant during the entire trip. In reality, their speed would have been slower when paddling in the canoe than when hiking on the trail, because the canoe is slower and requires more effort.

We can calculate his distance for this part of the trip as:\n\ndistance = rate x time\ndistance = 12 x (4.5 - t)\n\nNow we know that the total distance of the trip was 70 miles.

For simplicity, here we will use the method of substitution. \n\nFrom equation 1, we can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other: \n\nn + d = 50 \n\nn = 50 - d \n\nWe can substitute this expression for 'n' into equation 2: \n\n0.05n + 0.1d = 3.5 \n\n0.05(50 - d) + 0.1d = 3.5 \n\n2.5 - 0.05d + 0.1d = 3.5 \n\n0.05d = 1 \n\nd = 20 \n\nSo Jill has 20 dimes. To find the number of nickels, we can substitute this value back into equation 1: \n\nn + d = 50 \n\nn + 20 = 50 \n\nn = 30 \n\nTherefore, Jill has 30 nickels and 20 dimes.", "prompt_tokens": 48, "completion_tokens": 348, "total_tokens": 396}

Let's use 'b' for the number of hours the bricklayer worked and 'e' for the number of hours the electrician worked. \n\nWe know that the bricklayer earns $12 per hour and the electrician earns $16 per hour, so we can write two equations based on their pay rates:\n\n12b = total pay for bricklayer \n16e = total pay for electrician \n\nWe also know that the two workers together spent a total of 90 hours working on the house, so we can write another equation combining their hours:\n\nb + e = 90 \n\nFinally, we know that the owner paid them a total of $1350, so we can write one more equation based on their total pay:\n\n12b + 16e = 1350 \n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three variables.

When the boat is going upstream (against the current), it has to work harder to maintain its speed relative to the water. So its speed relative to land is actually 16 - c.

In other words:\n\nx + (x-30) = 2x-30\n\nWe also know that they pass each other after 3 hours, and that they started 390 km apart. So the distance each train traveled is:\n\ndistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nFor the express train:\n\ndistance = x \u00d7 3 = 3x\n\nFor the freight train:\n\ndistance = (x-30) \u00d7 3 = 3x - 90\n\nAnd since they passed each other, their two distances add up to the total distance between them:\n\n3x + (3x-90) = 390\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n6x - 90 = 390\n\nAdding 90 to both sides:\n\n6x = 480\n\nDividing by 6:\n\nx = 80\n\nSo the speed of the express train is 80 km/hr.

It says 'Desiree is twice as old as her cousin now' - so we know that the ages we're looking for should be positive.

Let's start from scratch with just the information we have: \n\nD = 2C (Desiree is twice as old as her cousin now) \n\nD + 30 = 0.6666666(C + 30) + 14 (In 30 years, Desiree will be 14 more than 0.6666666 of her cousin's age) \n\nSimplifying the second equation: \n\nD + 30 = 0.6666666C + 20 \n\nSubstituting D = 2C: \n\n2C + 30 = 0.6666666C + 20 \n\n1.3333334C = -10 \n\nC = -7.5 \n\nAs before, we've gotten a negative age for Desiree's cousin, so let's try one more time with the assumption that we were supposed to use past ages: \n\nD = 2(C - 30) (Desiree is currently twice the age her cousin was 30 years ago) \n\nD + 30 = 0.6666666(C - 30 + 30) + 14 (In 30 years, Desiree will be 14 more than 0.6666666 of her cousin's age) \n\nSimplifying the second equation: \n\nD + 30 = 0.6666666C + 14 \n\nSubstituting D = 2(C - 30): \n\n2(C - 30) + 30 = 0.6666666C + 14 \n\n1.3333334C = 56 \n\nC = 42 \n\nSo Desiree's cousin is currently 42 years old, which means Desiree is currently 84 years old. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: Desiree is currently 84 years old.", "prompt_tokens": 63, "completion_tokens": 968, "total_tokens": 1031}

That doesn't make sense, since you can't sell a fraction of a ticket. \n\nThis tells us that there's an error in our work somewhere - we made a mistake and our solution doesn't actually work. Let's go back and check our work. \n\nOne mistake we might have made is assuming that the number of couple tickets sold is a whole number. But that doesn't necessarily have to be the case - we could have sold 1.5 couple tickets, for example, if three people split the cost. \n\nLet's modify our approach slightly to allow for fractions: \n\n- Let's call the number of single tickets sold 'a' and the number of couple tickets sold 'b', where each couple ticket represents two people. That means the total number of attendees is a + 2b. \n- From the problem, we know the following: \n    - a + b = 128 (since there were 128 people total) \n    - 20a + 35b = 2280 (since ticket sales totaled $2280) \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, but this time it's okay if we get fractions for our solutions. Let's solve for b using the first equation: \n\nb = 128 - a \n\nNow substitute this expression for b into the second equation: \n\n20a + 35b = 2280 \n20a + 35(128 - a) = 2280 \n20a + 4480 - 35a = 2280 \n\nSimplify and solve for a: \n\n-15a = -2200 \na = 146.67 \n\nUh-oh, another fraction! That means we made another mistake. This time, we assumed that each couple ticket was bought by one couple (two people). But it's possible that some couple tickets were split by more than two people - for example, three friends might have split the cost of a couple ticket. \n\nLet's modify our approach again: \n\n- Let's call the number of single tickets sold 'm' and the number of couple tickets sold 'n', but now each couple ticket represents any number of people (not just two). That means the total number of attendees is m + n. \n- From the problem, we know the following: \n    - m + n = 128 (since there were 128 people total) \n    - 20m + 35n = 2280 (since ticket sales totaled $2280) \n\nNow let's try solving for m using the first equation: \n\nm = 128 - n \n\nSubstitute this expression for m into the second equation: \n\n20m + 35n = 2280 \n20(128 - n) + 35n = 2280 \n2560 - 15n = 2280 \n\nSolve for n: \n\n-15n = -280 \nn = 18.67 \n\nFinally, we have a solution that works! This tells us that 18.67 couple tickets were sold, which is equivalent to 37.33 individual attendees (assuming that each person who bought a couple ticket was split evenly between two tickets). \n\nTo summarize: \n\n- The number of single tickets sold is m = 128 - n = 109.33 \n- The number of couple tickets sold is n = 18.67 \n\nTherefore, approximately 109 single tickets and 19 couple tickets were sold.", "prompt_tokens": 60, "completion_tokens": 932, "total_tokens": 992}

Using the first equation: \n6(1.50) + 8y = 24.60 \n\nSimplify: \n9 + 8y = 24.60 \n\nSubtract 9 from both sides: \n8y = 15.60 \n\nDivide both sides by 8: \ny \u2248 1.95 \n\nSo a burger costs about $1.95. \n\nTherefore, each milkshake costs $1.50 and each burger costs $1.95.", "prompt_tokens": 78, "completion_tokens": 1105, "total_tokens": 1183}
