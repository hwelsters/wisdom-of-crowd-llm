Let's call the number of graphing calculators sold 'G' and the number of scientific calculators sold 'S.' \n\nWe know from the problem that the graphing calculators cost $87 each, so the total revenue generated from selling 'G' graphing calculators would be 87G. Similarly, the scientific calculators cost $18 each, so the total revenue generated from selling 'S' scientific calculators would be 18S. \n\nWe are given that the total sales generated (revenue) were $4980, so we can set up an equation: \n\n87G + 18S = 4980 \n\nWe are also given that 15 more graphing calculators were sold than scientific calculators, so we can set up another equation: \n\nG = S + 15 \n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve simultaneously using substitution or elimination. For this example, let's use substitution: \n\nWe can substitute the expression for G in the first equation with the second equation: \n\n87(S + 15) + 18S = 4980 \n\nDistribute the 87: \n\n87S + 1305 + 18S = 4980 \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n105S + 1305 = 4980 \n\nSubtract 1305 from both sides: \n\n105S = 3675 \n\nDivide both sides by 105: \n\nS = 35 \n\nSo the bookstore sold 35 scientific calculators. \n\nWe can use the second equation to find out how many graphing calculators were sold: \n\nG = S + 15 \n\nG = 35 + 15 \n\nG = 50 \n\nSo the bookstore sold 50 graphing calculators. \n\nTherefore, the bookstore sold 50 graphing calculators and 35 scientific calculators.", "prompt_tokens": 83, "completion_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 469}

This means our initial setup of equations is incorrect and there is no solution to the problem. \n\nWe made a mistake by assuming that we can use any amounts of soybean meal and cornmeal to make a 320-lb mixture. But since soybean meal has twice the protein content of cornmeal, we would need to use more soybean meal than cornmeal to get a mixture that is 14% protein. The correct setup of equations would be:\nx + y = 320 (total weight of the mixture)\n0.16x + 0.08y = 0.14(320) (total protein in the mixture)\n0.16x = 0.14(320) (requirement for protein content)\n\nSolving the last equation:\n0.16x = 0.14(320)\n0.16x = 44.8\nx = 280\n\nSo we need 280 pounds of soybean meal and:\ny = 320 - x\ny = 320 - 280\ny = 40\n\nWe need 280 pounds of soybean meal and 40 pounds of cornmeal to make a 320-pound mixture that is 14% protein.", "prompt_tokens": 58, "completion_tokens": 502, "total_tokens": 560}

If the drain stays open unnoticed , how long will it take to fill the tub with water ?", "response": "Let's call the time it takes to fill the tub with water 'x'. \n\nWe know that it takes 10 minutes to fill the tub with water and 12 minutes to drain it. So if the drain is open the whole time, we can set up the following equation: \n\nx/10 - x/12 = 1 \n\nThe left side of the equation represents the rate at which the water is entering the tub (x/10) minus the rate at which it's leaving (x/12). The right side of the equation represents the fact that we want to fill the tub with water completely (which we define as 1 'unit' of water). \n\nNow we need to solve for x. The first step is to get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, which in this case is 60: \n\n6x - 5x = 60 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nx = 60 \n\nSo it will take 60 minutes to fill the tub completely if the drain stays open unnoticed.", "prompt_tokens": 51, "completion_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 274}

Your brother can do it in 4 hours . How long does it take the two of you working together ?", "response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Work / Rate\n\nwhere 'Work' is the amount of painting to be done (in this case, painting the entire room), and 'Rate' is the rate of work (in this case, the rate at which each person can paint).\n\nLet's call the amount of painting to be done 'W' (which is simply the painting of the entire room). Let's also call your painting rate 'R1' and your brother's painting rate 'R2'. Then we can write:\n\nW = Amount of painting to be done (painting the entire room)\nR1 = Your painting rate (you paint the entire room in 3 hours, so your rate is 1/3 of the room per hour)\nR2 = Your brother's painting rate (he paints the entire room in 4 hours, so his rate is 1/4 of the room per hour)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula and solve for the time it takes when you and your brother work together:\n\nTime = Work / Rate\nTime = W / (R1 + R2)\n\nTime = Paint the entire room / (Your painting rate + Your brother's painting rate)\nTime = W / (1/3 + 1/4)\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator:\n\nTime = W / (4/12 + 3/12)\nTime = W / (7/12)\n\nNow we can divide both sides by the fraction in the denominator:\n\nTime * (7/12) = W\nTime = W / (7/12)\n\nTo find the value of 'W', we can use the fact that the entire room needs to be painted. Let's say the room has an area of 120 square meters. Then the amount of painting to be done is simply 120 square meters. Therefore:\n\nW = 120 square meters\n\nNow we can plug this value into the formula and solve for the time it takes when you and your brother work together:\n\nTime = W / (7/12)\nTime = 120 square meters / (7/12)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal (flipping the fraction over):\n\nTime = 120 square meters * (12/7)\nTime = 205.71 minutes, or about 3 hours and 26 minutes\n\nTherefore, it takes you and your brother about 3 hours and 26 minutes to paint the room together.", "prompt_tokens": 48, "completion_tokens": 514, "total_tokens": 562}

We can use the formula distance = rate \u00d7 time to express this as an equation:\ndistance traveled by the freight train = y (t + 2), where t is the time (in hours) the trains travel before they meet.\n\n2) The passenger train overtakes the freight train in 3 hours. We can use the same formula distance = rate \u00d7 time to express this as an equation:\ndistance traveled by the passenger train = x t\n\nSince the two trains meet each other, they must have traveled the same distance when they meet. So we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x and y:\n\nxt = y (t + 2)\nxt = yt + 2y\nxt - yt = 2y\n(t)(x - y) = 2y\nt = 2y / (x - y)\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t into either of the two equations we set up earlier. Let's use the second one:\n\ndistance traveled by the passenger train = x t\ndistance traveled by the passenger train = x (2y / (x - y))\n\nWe know that the distance traveled by the passenger train is also the distance traveled by the freight train, so we can set this equal to the expression we came up with for the distance traveled by the freight train:\n\nx (2y / (x - y)) = y (t + 2)\n\nNow we can simplify this equation and solve for x and y:\n\n2xy / (x - y) = yt + 2y\n2xy = y(x - y)t + 2y(x - y)\n2xy = yt(x - y) + 2y(x - y)\n2xy = (2y)(x - y)\nx = 3y\n\nSo the speed of the passenger train is three times the speed of the freight train.
