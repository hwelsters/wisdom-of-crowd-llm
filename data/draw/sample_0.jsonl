Th Accucheck plan costs $ 1.12 a month , plus 22 cents per check . For what number of checks will the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan ?", "response": "\n\nLet's start by finding a general expression for the cost of each plan, based on the number of checks written.\n\nFor the Anywhere plan, the cost is simply 30 cents per check. So if we write x checks, the cost would be:\n\nCost = 0.3x\n\nFor the Accucheck plan, the cost is $ 1.12 per month, plus 22 cents per check. So the cost for x checks would be:\n\nCost = 1.12 + 0.22x\n\nNow we need to find the number of checks x for which the Accucheck plan costs less than the Anywhere plan. In other words, we want to find the value of x for which:\n\n1.12 + 0.22x < 0.3x\n\nSimplifying the inequality:\n\n1.12 < 0.08x\n\nDividing both sides by 0.08:\n\n14 < x\n\nSo the Accucheck plan will cost less than the Anywhere plan if we write more than 14 checks per month. For example, if we write 15 checks, the cost for the Accucheck plan would be:\n\nCost = 1.12 + 0.22(15) = $4.22\n\nWhile the cost for the Anywhere plan would be:\n\nCost = 0.3(15) = $4.50\n\nTherefore, the Accucheck plan would be the better option."}

This means that we have an extra variable and not enough equations to solve for both M and U. We need one more equation.\n\nLet's think about what we know. We know that Mike's age decreased by his sister's age is 11. This means that Mike is at least 11 years old. We also know that his age increased by his uncle's age is 53. This means that Mike is no more than 53 years old.\n\nSince we are looking for Mike's uncle's age, we can make an educated guess and assume that Mike is closer to 11 than 53. Let's try M = 15.\n\nIf M = 15, then:\n\nS = M - 11 = 4\n\nU = 64 - 2M = 34\n\nThis means that if Mike is 15 years old, then his sister is 4 years old and his uncle is 34 years old.

First, we can solve for t1 in the time inequality:\n\nt1 \u2264 20 - t2\n\nThen we can substitute that into the equation for d1:\n\nd1 = 70t1 = 70(20 - t2) = 1400 - 70t2\n\nNow we can substitute both equations into the first equation:\n\nd1 + d2 = 1800\n\n1400 - 70t2 + d2 = 1800\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd2 = 400 + 70t2\n\nWe know that t2 is between 0 and 20 (since he ran for some amount of time and the total time was 20 minutes or less), so we can see that d2 is between 0 and 15400 m (when t2 = 220/7 min). Therefore, Tom ran between 0 and 15400 m to get to school in 20 minutes or less."}

This means that we've made a mistake somewhere along the way. Let's go back and check our calculations.\n\nFirst, we need to make sure that we're using the correct number of pages allotted for the article. The problem states that there are 21 full pages, but it doesn't say whether these are all the same size or not. Let's assume for now that they're all the same size and see where that takes us.\n\nIf each page has the same number of words, we can find out how many words per page by dividing the total number of words in the article by the number of pages:\n\n48,000 / 21 = 2,285.71\n\nAgain, we can't have a fraction of a word, so we'll round up to 2,286 words per page. Now we can figure out how many pages we need of each type:\n\nPages of larger type = 1,800 / 2,286 * 21 = 16.5 (round up to 17)\nPages of smaller type = 2,400 / 2,286 * 21 = 22.0 (round down to 22)\n\nSo we need 17 pages of the larger type and 22 pages of the smaller type to print the article."}

We can set up another equation:\n\nb + c = (distance downstream) / (time downstream)\n\nWe're given that the boat's constant speed relative to the water is 16 miles per hour, which means:\n\nb = 16\n\nNow we just need to solve for 'c'. \n\nLet's start with the upstream equation. We're told that the boat makes the trip in 20 minutes (which is 1/3 of an hour). We don't know the distance, but we can represent it with a variable 'd'. So:\n\n16 - c = d / (1/3)\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 3:\n\n48 - 3c = d\n\nNow let's look at the downstream equation. We're told that the boat makes the trip in 15 minutes (which is 1/4 of an hour), and we don't know the distance here either. So:\n\n16 + c = d / (1/4)\n\nAgain, we can simplify by multiplying both sides by 4:\n\n64 + 4c = d\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables.

If we let t be the time it takes for Jose and Juanita to paint the room working together, then we can write:\n\nJose's rate of painting the room: 1 room / 2 hours\nJuanita's rate of painting the room: 1 room / 3 hours\n\nTheir combined rate of painting the room: 1 room / t hours\n\nThe idea is that if they work together, they can paint the same room in less time than if they work separately, because their rates add up. Therefore, we can set up an equation that says:\n\nJose's amount of work + Juanita's amount of work = Their combined amount of work\n\nThe amount of work is simply the fraction of the room that each person paints in one hour, which we can obtain by taking the reciprocal of their respective rates. Thus, we have:\n\n(1/2) t + (1/3) t = 1\n\nThis equation says that the amount of work they do together in t hours is equal to the whole room, which has a unit of 1. Now we can simplify this equation by finding a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(3/6) t + (2/6) t = 1\n\n(5/6) t = 1\n\nt = 6/5 hours\n\nTherefore, it would take Jose and Juanita 6/5 hours, or 1.2 hours, to paint the room working together.

Since we're dealing with just one year, t = 1 for both accounts.\n\nFor the 1% account, we can plug in the values we know and solve for I:\n\nI = x*0.01*1\nI = 0.01x\n\nFor the 3% account, we can do the same:\n\nI = y*0.03*1\nI = 0.03y\n\nSo the total interest earned will be:\n\n0.01x + 0.03y = 450\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nx + y = 20,000    (equation 1)\n0.01x + 0.03y = 450   (equation 2)\n\nWe can solve for one variable in terms of the other in equation 1:\n\nx = 20,000 - y\n\nNow we can substitute this into equation 2:\n\n0.01(20,000 - y) + 0.03y = 450\n\n200 - 0.01y + 0.03y = 450\n\n0.02y = 250\n\ny = 12,500\n\nSo Jake should invest $12,500 in the account earning 3% interest. To find out how much to invest in the 1% account, we can go back to equation 1 and solve for x:\n\nx + y = 20,000\nx + 12,500 = 20,000\nx = 7,500\n\nSo Jake should invest $7,500 in the account earning 1% interest."}

That means the combined amount of yellow paint should be:\n\n0.25(5 + x) = 1.25 + 0.25x \n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for x: \n\n1 gallon of yellow paint in the lighter green paint + 0.4x gallons of yellow paint in the darker green paint = 1.25 + 0.25x \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1 + 0.4x = 1.25 + 0.25x \n\nSubtracting 0.25x from both sides: \n\n1 + 0.15x = 1.25 \n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides: \n\n0.15x = 0.25 \n\nDividing both sides by 0.15: \n\nx = 1.67 \n\nSo we need to use 1.67 gallons of the darker green paint to create a green paint that is 25% yellow paint."}

How many miles did he drive in the city ?", "response": "\n\n\nLet's assume that Samuel drove x miles on the highway and y miles in the city.\n\nWe know that the total distance he drove was 365 miles. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 365\n\nWe also know that he used 11 gallons of gasoline. Using the information about his car's fuel efficiency, we can calculate the total distance he could have driven on 11 gallons:\n\nTotal distance = 37 miles per gallon on the highway * x miles on the highway + 30 miles per gallon in the city * y miles in the city\nTotal distance = 37x + 30y\n\nNow we can set up another equation:\n\nTotal distance = 11 gallons *  (miles per gallon)\n\nSubstituting the expression we derived for total distance:\n\n37x + 30y = 11 * (37 + 30)\n37x + 30y = 407\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve for one variable in one equation and substitute into the other equation.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 365 - x\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n37x + 30(365 - x) = 407\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n37x + 10950 - 30x = 407\n7x = 407 - 10950\n7x = -10543\nx = -1506.14\n\nThis is a problem. We cannot have negative miles. This means that our assumption that Samuel drove some miles on the highway and some miles in the city is incorrect.\n\nWe need to re-evaluate our assumption. We know that Samuel used 11 gallons of gasoline and got an average of 33.18 miles per gallon (365 miles / 11 gallons). This average must be a weighted average of the fuel efficiency on the highway and in the city. We can set up an equation:\n\n(37x + 30y) / (x + y) = 33.18\n\nSimplifying:\n\n37x + 30y = 33.18x + 33.18y\n3.82x = 3.18y\ny = x * 1.2\n\nThis means that Samuel drove 1.2 times as many miles in the city as he did on the highway. We can set up a new equation based on this information:\n\nx + 1.2x = 365\n2.2x = 365\nx = 165.91\n\nTherefore, Samuel drove approximately 166 miles on the highway and 199 miles in the city."}

To find out how long it will take them to clean the whole room, we can use the formula:\n\nTime taken = Work done / Rate of work\n\nSince the work required is one unit, we can say:\n\nTime taken = 1 / (5/24)\n           = 24/5\n           = 4.8 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take Lisa and Kay 4.8 hours to clean their room together."}

How old is Mary now ?", "response": "\n\nLet's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet's call Jay's current age 'J' and Mary's current age 'M'. \n\nWe know that 5 years ago, Jay was 7 years older than Mary: \n\nJ - 5 = M - 5 + 7 \n\nSimplifying this equation: \n\nJ - M = 7 \n\nWe also know that in 5 years, Jay will be twice as old as Mary: \n\nJ + 5 = 2(M + 5) \n\nSimplifying this equation: \n\nJ + 5 = 2M + 10 \n\nJ - 2M = 5 \n\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns: \n\nJ - M = 7 \n\nJ - 2M = 5 \n\nWe can solve for J by adding the two equations together: \n\nJ - M + J - 2M = 7 + 5 \n\n2J - 3M = 12 \n\nWe can solve for J again by isolating it: \n\n2J = 3M + 12 \n\nJ = (3M + 12) / 2 \n\nNow, we can substitute this value for J into one of the original equations to solve for M: \n\nJ - M = 7 \n\n((3M + 12) / 2) - M = 7 \n\n3M + 12 - 2M = 14 \n\nM = 2 \n\nSo Mary is currently 2 years old. To check our work, we can find Jay's current age: \n\nJ = (3M + 12) / 2 \n\nJ = (3(2) + 12) / 2 \n\nJ = 9 \n\nSo Jay is currently 9 years old. \n\nTherefore, 5 years ago, Mary was -3 years old and Jay was 2 years older than her. This doesn't make sense in the real world, so we know that our initial assumption that 5 years ago Jay was 7 years older than Mary must be incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that there is no solution to the problem as stated. It's possible that there is a typo or some other error in the problem, or that there are additional constraints that would allow us to find a solution."}

The plane then travels back 100 miles with a head wind . The travel time is 40 min more than the first trip . What is the speed of the wind , and the speed of the plane ?", "response": "\n\nLet's call the speed of the plane (relative to the air) 'p' and the speed of the wind 'w'. \n\nWhen the plane is flying with the tailwind, its effective speed is p+w. We're told it covers 100 miles in 60 minutes, so we can set up the equation: \n\n(p+w)(60/60) = 100 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\np+w = 100 \n\nNow, when the plane is flying against the headwind, its effective speed is p-w. We're told it takes 40 minutes longer to cover the same distance as before, so the time it takes is 60 + 40 = 100 minutes. We can set up another equation: \n\n(p-w)(100/60) = 100 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\np-w = 60 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables: \n\np+w = 100 \np-w = 60 \n\nWe can solve for one of the variables using one equation, and substitute it into the other: \n\np = 100-w \np = 60+w \n\nSetting the two expressions equal to each other: \n\n100-w = 60+w \n\nSolving for w: \n\n2w = 40 \nw = 20 \n\nNow we know the speed of the wind is 20 mph. We can substitute that into one of the equations to solve for the speed of the plane: \n\np+20 = 100 \np = 80 \n\nSo the speed of the plane is 80 mph. \n\nTo check our answers, we can make sure they work in both equations: \n\n80+20 = 100 (with tailwind) \n(80-20)(100/60) = 100 (against headwind, takes 100 minutes) \n\nBoth equations check out, so we're good to go!"}

This doesn't make any sense. We can't have a negative age. So, there must be something wrong with our equations or our reasoning.\n\nLet's go back and check our work. One thing that stands out is that we haven't used the fact that the problem is asking for what happened 5 years ago. So, let's try that instead.\n\nFive years ago, Mary's age would have been M - 5, and her Son's age would have been S - 5. We know that Mary was 5 times as old as her son, so:\n\nM - 5 = 5(S - 5)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nM - 5 = 5S - 25\nM = 5S - 20\n\nNow, let's use the second piece of information, but this time we'll use 'x' to represent Mary's age 3 years from now, and 'y' to represent her son's age 3 years from now:\n\nx = 3(y+3) - 8\n\nWe can also write 'x' and 'y' in terms of 'M' and 'S':\n\nx = M + 3\ny = S + 3\n\nSubstituting into the equation above:\n\nM + 3 = 3(S+3) - 8\nM + 3 = 3S + 9 - 8\nM = 3S + 4\n\nNow we have two equations for M:\n\nM = 5S - 20\nM = 3S + 4\n\nSetting these equal to each other:\n\n5S - 20 = 3S + 4\n\nSolving for S:\n\n2S = 24\nS = 12\n\nNow we can use either equation for M to find Mary's age:\n\nM = 5S - 20\nM = 5(12) - 20\nM = 40\n\nSo, Mary is currently 40 years old, and her son is 12.\n\nTo check, we can make sure that the second piece of information also holds true:\n\nx = 3(y+3) - 8\nx = 3(15) - 8\nx = 37\n\nChecking 3 years from now, Mary will be 43 and her son will be 15. 43 is indeed 8 less than 3 times 15, so this checks out."}

We are given that $a+b=6$.\n\nThe second number formed by reversing the digits is $10b+a$.\n\nWhen the second number is subtracted from the first, we get $(10a+b)-(10b+a)=9(a-b)$. And three times the sum of the digits is $3(a+b)=18$.\n\nSo, we need to solve the equation $9(a-b)=18$, or equivalently, $a-b=2$. Since $a+b=6$, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b &= 6 \\\\\na-b &= 2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving this system gives $a=4$ and $b=2$.

What is the planes speed in still air ?", "response": "\n\nLet's call the speed of the plane in still air 'x' and the speed of the wind 'y'. \n\nWhen the plane is flying with the tailwind, its effective speed is x+y. \n\nUsing the formula: \n\ndistance = rate \u00d7 time \n\nWe can write the equation: \n\n900 = (x+y) \u00d7 3 \n\nSimilarly, when the plane is flying against the wind, its effective speed is x-y. \n\nSo, the equation in this case would be: \n\n900 = (x-y) \u00d7 4 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve for one of the variables and substitute that into the other equation to solve for the second variable. \n\nLet's solve for y in the first equation: \n\n900 = 3x + 3y \n\n300 = x + y \n\nNow we can substitute this value of y into the second equation and solve for x: \n\n900 = 4x - 4y \n\n900 = 4x - 4(300-x) \n\n900 = 4x - 1200 + 4x \n\n2100 = 8x \n\nx = 262.5 \n\nTherefore, the speed of the plane in still air is 262.5 miles per hour."}

The two cars combined drives a total of 1825 miles in that one week , for a total gas consumption of 55 gallons . How many gallons were consumed by each of the two cars that week ?", "response": "\n\nLet's use algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet x be the number of gallons consumed by the first car, and y be the number of gallons consumed by the second car. \n\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the given information: \n\nx + y = 55 (total gas consumption) \n\nx/25 + y/40 = 1825/55 (total distance driven) \n\nSimplifying the second equation by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 25 and 40 (which is 100), we get: \n\n4x + 2.5y = 364 \n\nNow we can solve the system of equations. One way to do this is to use substitution: \n\nx = 55 - y (from the first equation) \n\n4(55 - y) + 2.5y = 364 (substituting into the second equation) \n\n220 - 4y + 2.5y = 364 \n\n-1.5y = 144 \n\ny = -96 (which doesn't make sense, since we can't consume negative gallons of gas) \n\nSo, there must be something wrong with our system of equations. Looking at the second equation, we can see that it doesn't make sense to add miles per gallon and miles per gallon together (since they have different units). We need to separate the distance and the gas consumption for each car. \n\nLet d1 be the distance driven by the first car, and d2 be the distance driven by the second car. Then we have: \n\nd1 + d2 = 1825 (total distance) \n\nd1/25 + d2/40 = 55 (total gas consumption) \n\nMultiplying the second equation by 100 to simplify, we get: \n\n4d1 + 2.5d2 = 5500 \n\nNow we can solve the system of equations using substitution again: \n\nd1 = 1825 - d2 (from the first equation) \n\n4(1825 - d2) + 2.5d2 = 5500 (substituting into the second equation) \n\n7300 - 4d2 + 2.5d2 = 5500 \n\n-1.5d2 = -1800 \n\nd2 = 1200 \n\nSo the second car drove 1200 miles, and the first car drove the remaining distance: \n\nd1 = 1825 - 1200 = 625 \n\nNow we can calculate the gas consumption for each car: \n\nx = 625/25 = 25 gallons (first car) \n\ny = 1200/40 = 30 gallons (second car) \n\nTherefore, the first car consumed 25 gallons of gas, and the second car consumed 30 gallons of gas."}

We can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\n7x = 12(some number) - 3300\n\n7x = 12(some number - 275)\n\nx = 12/7(some number - 275)\n\nNow we know that x is equal to 12/7 times the difference between 'some number' and 275. We also know that x is the smaller number in the ratio of 7 to 12.\n\nTo find the larger number, we can use the ratio of 7 to 12 to set up another equation:\n\n7/12 x = some other number\n\nWe can substitute in our expression for x:\n\n7/12(12/7(some number - 275)) = some other number\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the 7 and 12:\n\nsome number - 275 = some other number\n\nNow we know that the difference between 'some number' and 275 is equal to the larger number in the ratio of 7 to 12. We can solve for this number by adding 275 to both sides:\n\nsome number = some other number + 275\n\nSo the two numbers we're looking for are x (the smaller number) and some other number plus 275 (the larger number). We can substitute in our expressions for x and some number:\n\nx = 12/7(some number - 275)\n\nsome other number plus 275 = some number + 275\n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting 275 from both sides:\n\nsome other number = some number - 275\n\nNow we have expressions for both numbers:\n\nx = 12/7(some number - 275)\n\nsome other number = some number - 275\n\nWe don't know what 'some number' is, but we can choose any value we want and plug it in to get our two numbers. Let's choose 100:\n\nx = 12/7(100 - 275) = -300\n\nsome other number = 100 - 275 = -175\n\nSo the two numbers in the ratio of 7 to 12 that differ by 275 are -300 and -175."}

We'll use variables to represent the cost of a milkshake and the cost of a burger. Let's call the cost of a milkshake 'm' and the cost of a burger 'b'.\n\nFrom the first order, we know that:\n\n6m + 8b = 24.60\n\nFrom the second order, we know that:\n\n3m + 5b = 14.25\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve simultaneously. There are different methods we can use to do this, but we'll use substitution. Rearranging the first equation, we can solve for m in terms of b:\n\n6m + 8b = 24.60\n6m = 24.60 - 8b\nm = (24.60 - 8b)/6\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for m into the second equation:\n\n3m + 5b = 14.25\n3[(24.60 - 8b)/6] + 5b = 14.25\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to get rid of the fraction, we get:\n\n3(24.60 - 8b) + 30b = 85.50\n\nExpanding the brackets, we get:\n\n73.8 - 24b + 30b = 85.50\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n6b = 11.70\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\nb = 1.95\n\nSo the cost of a burger is $1.95.\n\nWe can now substitute this value of b back into either of the original equations to find the value of m. Let's use the first equation:\n\n6m + 8b = 24.60\n6m + 8(1.95) = 24.60\n6m + 15.60 = 24.60\n6m = 9\nm = 1.50\n\nSo the cost of a milkshake is $1.50.\n\nTherefore, the cost of each item is:\n\n- Milkshake: $1.50\n- Burger: $1.95"}

For Chris, the distance he traveled is C \u00d7 0.5. Since they were going in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of these distances:\n\ndistance between them = B \u00d7 0.5 + C \u00d7 0.5\n\nWe know that this distance is 14 miles, so we can set up an equation:\n\nB \u00d7 0.5 + C \u00d7 0.5 = 14\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.5(B + C) = 14\n\nDividing both sides by 0.5, we get:\n\nB + C = 28\n\nWe also know that Bill was going 2 miles per hour faster than Chris, so we can set up another equation:\n\nB = C + 2\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n(C + 2) + C = 28\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2C + 2 = 28\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n\n2C = 26\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nC = 13\n\nSo Chris was traveling at a speed of 13 miles per hour.

To check if our solution is correct, we can use the first equation to see if their ages in 4 years match up:\n\nN + 4 = 48\n\n3(D + 4) = 3(16) = 48\n\nSo our answer is correct: in 4 years, Nan will be 48 and Dan will be 16, and Nan will indeed be 3 times as old as Dan."}

Solving for y in the first equation, we get:\n\ny = (7/2)x\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx - (7/2)x = 5\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(5/2)x = 5\n\nx = 2\n\nSubstituting this back into y = (7/2)x, we get:\n\ny = 7\n\nTherefore, the two-digit number is 27, which is 3 times the sum of its digits (2+7=9) and is 45 less than its reverse (72-27=45)."}

We can use C for the number of children's tickets and A for the number of adult tickets. Here's what we know:\n\n- The cost of a children's ticket is $7.50\n- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.00\n- Cody ordered 8 more children's tickets than adult tickets\n- Her total bill was $138\n\nUsing these pieces of information, we can write two equations to represent the problem:\n\nC = A + 8         (1)   (the number of children's tickets is 8 more than the number of adult tickets)\n7.5C + 12A = 138  (2)   (the total cost of the tickets is $138)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for C and A. Let's use substitution.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can write:\n\nC = A + 8\n\nWe can substitute this expression for C in equation (2):\n\n7.5C + 12A = 138\n\n7.5(A + 8) + 12A = 138   (substituting C = A + 8)\n\n7.5A + 60 + 12A = 138    (distributing the 7.5)\n\n19.5A = 78              (combining like terms)\n\nA = 4                   (dividing both sides by 19.5)\n\nNow we know that Cody ordered 4 adult tickets. We can use equation (1) to find the number of children's tickets:\n\nC = A + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nTherefore, Cody ordered 12 children's tickets and 4 adult tickets.\n\nCheck:\n\n12 * 7.5 + 4 * 12 = 138\n\nThe total cost is $138, so our solution is correct."}

We can start by rearranging the first equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\nx = $10,000 - y\n\nThen we can substitute that into the second equation:\n\n0.11($10,000 - y) - 0.04y = $650\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$1,100 - 0.11y - 0.04y = $650\n\n$1,100 - 0.15y = $650\n\n-0.15y = -$450\n\ny = $3,000\n\nNow that we know y, we can plug that back into the first equation to find x:\n\nx + $3,000 = $10,000\n\nx = $7,000\n\nSo Sam invested $7,000 in the 11% profit fund and $3,000 in the 4% loss stock."}

Sylvia can complete a job in 45 minutes working alone . Carla takes 30 minutes to complete the same job . How long would it take if they worked together ?", "response": "\n\nTo set up this problem, we need to use the concept of 'work rate' or 'job efficiency' of each person. We can express their work rates as follows:\n\nSylvia's work rate: 1 job/45 minutes, or equivalently, 1/45 job/minute (she can complete 1 job in 45 minutes)\n\nCarla's work rate: 1 job/30 minutes, or equivalently, 1/30 job/minute (she can complete 1 job in 30 minutes)\n\nNow, we need to find their combined work rate when they work together. Since they are working on the same job, their work rates add up. Therefore, their combined work rate is:\n\nSylvia's work rate + Carla's work rate = 1/45 job/minute + 1/30 job/minute\n\nTo add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 90. Then:\n\n1/45 job/minute + 1/30 job/minute = (2/90 + 3/90) job/minute = 5/90 job/minute\n\nTherefore, when Sylvia and Carla work together, they can complete 5/90 of the job every minute. To find out how long it would take for them to complete the whole job, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Job/Work rate\n\nwhere 'job' is 1 (since they are completing one job), and 'work rate' is 5/90 job/minute. Then:\n\nTime = 1/(5/90) = 18 minutes\n\nTherefore, it would take Sylvia and Carla 18 minutes to complete the job if they work together."}

Please Help ?", "response": "\n\nLet's call the amount Deborah invested in the Bryce Bond Fund 'x', and the amount she invested in the Strauss Stock Fund 'y'. Then we know:\n\nx + y = 20,000 (because she split $20,000 between the two investments)\n\nWe also know that she earned $1,836.88 in total for the year, so:\n\n0.08x + 0.12y = 1,836.88 (because the Bryce Bond Fund has an 8% annual yield and the Strauss Stock Fund has a 12% annual yield)\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet's use substitution. From the first equation, we can rearrange it to solve for one variable in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 20,000 - y\n\nNow we can substitute that expression for x into the second equation:\n\n0.08(20,000 - y) + 0.12y = 1,836.88\n\nSimplifying and solving for y:\n\n1,600 - 0.08y + 0.12y = 1,836.88\n0.04y = 236.88\ny = 5,922\n\nSo Deborah invested $5,922 in the Strauss Stock Fund. To find out how much she invested in the Bryce Bond Fund, we can substitute back into one of the original equations (let's use the first one):\n\nx + 5,922 = 20,000\nx = 14,078\n\nTherefore, Deborah invested $14,078 in the Bryce Bond Fund and $5,922 in the Strauss Stock Fund."}

The final mixture is 40 % water . How many liters of water are in the final mixture ?", "response": "\n\nLet's start with the amount of acid in the final mixture. We know that we started with 5 liters of pure acid, and we added a certain amount of 10% acid. Let's call this amount 'x' (in liters). \n\nSo the total amount of acid in the final mixture is:\n\n5 + 0.1x \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the amount of water in the final mixture. We started with 90% water, and we added some more water. Let's call the amount of water added 'y' (in liters). \n\nSo the total amount of water in the final mixture is:\n\n0.9(5) + y \n\nNow we can use the fact that the final mixture is 40% water. This means that the amount of water is 40% of the total volume of the mixture. \n\nSetting the two expressions for acid and water equal to each other, we get: \n\n5 + 0.1x = 0.4(5 + x + y) \n\nSimplifying: \n\n5 + 0.1x = 2 + 0.4x + 0.4y \n\n0.3x - 0.4y = -3 \n\nWe need another equation to solve for both x and y. Notice that the amount of acid and the amount of water must add up to the total volume of the mixture: \n\n5 + x + y = total volume \n\nBut we don't know the total volume. However, we can use the fact that the percentage of acid in the final mixture is the same as in the original 10% acid. In other words, the amount of acid is 10% of the total volume: \n\n0.1(x + 5) = 0.1(total volume) \n\nSimplifying: \n\n0.1x + 0.5 = 0.1(total volume) \n\n0.1x = 0.1(total volume) - 0.5 \n\n0.1x = 0.1(total volume - 5) \n\nx = total volume - 50 \n\nNow we substitute this value of x into the first equation we derived: \n\n0.3(total volume - 50) - 0.4y = -3 \n\n0.3total volume - 15 - 0.4y = -3 \n\n0.4y = 12 - 0.3total volume \n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for y into the equation for total volume: \n\n5 + (total volume - 50) + (12 - 0.3total volume)/0.4 = total volume \n\n8 + 0.25total volume = total volume \n\n0.75total volume = 8 \n\ntotal volume = 10.67 \n\nSo the total volume of the final mixture is 10.67 liters. We can now use this to find the amount of water added: \n\n0.9(5) + y = 4.8 + y = 0.4(10.67) = 4.268 \n\ny = -0.532 \n\nUh oh, we got a negative value for y. This means there is no solution that satisfies all the conditions. We made a mistake somewhere in the calculations. However, we can check our answer for x: \n\n0.1x + 5 = 0.1(total volume) \n\n0.1x + 5 = 1.067 \n\n0.1x = -3.933 \n\nAgain, a negative value. So we made a mistake earlier. Let's start over and try again. \n\nThis time, we'll write the equation for the total amount of acid as: \n\n0.1(x + 5) + 5 = 0.1(total volume) \n\n0.1x + 5.5 = 0.1(total volume) \n\n10x + 55 = total volume \n\nAnd the equation for the total amount of water: \n\n0.9(5) + y = 4.5 + y \n\n0.4(total volume) = 0.4(10x + 55) = 4 + 0.4y \n\nMultiplying by 10: \n\n4x + 22 = x + y \n\nRearranging: \n\ny = 3x + 22 \n\nSubstituting into the previous equation: \n\n4x + 22 = 4 + 0.4(3x + 22) \n\n4x + 22 = 1.2x + 13.6 \n\n2.8x = -8.4 \n\nx = -3 \n\nAnother negative value! Okay, we need to check our assumptions here. It seems like we must have made an error in setting up the problem. Let's go through it step by step: \n\n- We started with 5 liters of pure acid. \n- We added x liters of 10% acid. \n- We added y liters of water. \n- The percentage of water in the final mixture is 40%. \n\nWe want to know the value of y. \n\nLet's see if we can figure out a relationship between x, y, and the total volume of the mixture: \n\n- Initially, the total amount of acid is 5 liters. \n- After we add the 10% acid, the total amount of acid is 5 + x liters. \n- The amount of water is 0.9(5) + y = 4.5 + y. \n- Once we mix the two solutions, we have a total volume of 5 + x + y liters. \n- The percentage of water in the final mixture is 40%, so the amount of water is 0.4(5 + x + y) = 2 + 0.4x + 0.4y liters. \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\n5 + x + 4.5 + y = 5 + x + y + 0.4(5 + x + y) \n\n9.5 + x + y = 7 + 0.4x + 0.4y \n\n2.1x - 0.6y = -2.5 \n\nAnd: \n\n5 + x + y = total volume \n\n0.1(5 + x) = 0.1(total volume) \n\n0.5 + 0.1x = 0.1total volume \n\n5 + x = 10total volume - 50 \n\nx = 10total volume - 55 \n\nSubstituting into the first equation: \n\n2.1(10total volume - 55) - 0.6y = -2.5 \n\n21total volume - 115 - 0.6y = -2.5 \n\n21total volume = 112.5 + 0.6y \n\nSubstituting into the second equation: \n\n5 + 10total volume - 55 + y = total volume \n\ny = 50 - 9total volume \n\nNow substituting back into the first equation: \n\n21total volume = 112.5 + 0.6(50 - 9total volume) \n\n21total volume = 139.5 - 5.4total volume \n\n26.4total volume = 139.5 \n\ntotal volume = 5.284 \n\nSubstituting into the equation for y: \n\ny = 50 - 9(5.284) \n\ny = 2.354 \n\nThis time we get a positive value for y, which means there is a solution that satisfies all the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the final mixture contains 2.354 liters of water."}

We know that the boat traveled 96 miles in 8 hours, so we can set up the equation:\n\n96 = (b - c) x 8\n\nWhen the boat is traveling with the current, the net speed is 'b + c'. We know that the boat returned to its starting point, so it traveled a total distance of 96 x 2 = 192 miles. We also know that the return trip took 5 hours, so we can set up the equation:\n\n192 = (b + c) x 5\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can use algebra to solve for 'b' and 'c'.

We can start by solving one equation for one of the variables in terms of the other, and then substitute that expression into the other equation to get an equation with just one variable. Let's solve the first equation for t1:\n\nt1 = d/20\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t1 into the second equation:\n\nt2 = d/30\n\nSubstituting both of these expressions into the third equation (the total driving time equation), we get:\n\nd/20 + d/30 = 1.5\n\nWe can simplify this equation by finding a common denominator:\n\n3d/60 + 2d/60 = 1.5\n\n5d/60 = 1.5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60, we get:\n\n5d = 90\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nd = 18\n\nNow we can use this value of d to find t1 and t2:\n\nt1 = d/20 = 18/20 = 0.9 hours (or 54 minutes)\n\nt2 = d/30 = 18/30 = 0.6 hours (or 36 minutes)\n\nSo it took Danielle 0.9 hours (54 minutes) to drive from school to home, and 0.6 hours (36 minutes) to drive from home back to school."}

After how many minutes used are the monthly costs of the plans equal ?", "response": "Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the total monthly cost, y, for each plan based on the number of minutes used, x.\n\nFor the first plan, y = 50 + 0.35(x - 500).\nFor the second plan, y = 75 + 0.45(x - 1000).\n\nWe want to find the point where these two equations intersect, which represents the number of minutes used when the costs of the plans are equal. To do this, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n50 + 0.35(x - 500) = 75 + 0.45(x - 1000)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n0.35x - 125 = 0.45x - 450\n\n0.1x = 325\n\nx = 3250\n\nTherefore, the plans have equal monthly costs when 3250 minutes are used.

For example, we can isolate d in the first equation: \n\n3d + 150m = 132 \n3d = 132 - 150m \nd = (132 - 150m)/3 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for d into the second equation: \n\n2((132 - 150m)/3) + 400m = 142 \n\nSimplifying: \n88 - 100m + 400m = 142 \n300m = 54 \nm = 0.18 \n\nWe found that the mileage charge is $0.18 per mile. \n\nTo find the daily fee, we can substitute this value of m back into either equation and solve for d. Let's use the first equation: \n\n3d + 150(0.18) = 132 \n3d + 27 = 132 \n3d = 105 \nd = 35 \n\nWe found that the daily fee is $35 per day. \n\nTherefore, the equation for the total charge for renting a U-Haul truck is: \n\nTotal charge = (35 \u00d7 number of days) + (0.18 \u00d7 number of miles)"}

Im not too sure where to begin maybe make a table ?", "response": "\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to use the method of 'mixtures' or 'alligations' which involves setting up a proportion based on the concentration and quantity of the ingredients in the solutions being mixed. Here's how:\n\nLet x be the quantity (in mL) of the 60% acid solution needed, and y be the quantity (in mL) of the 30% solution needed to make 630 mL of a 50% solution. Then we have:\n\n- The amount of acid in x mL of 60% solution is 0.6x\n- The amount of acid in y mL of 30% solution is 0.3y\n- The amount of acid in the final mixture of 630 mL of 50% solution is 0.5(630) = 315\n\nWe can set up the following proportion:\n\n0.6x + 0.3y = 0.5(630)\n\nSimplifying,\n\n0.6x + 0.3y = 315\n\nWe also know that x + y = 630 (because the total volume of the mixture is 630 mL).\n\nNow we can solve for x and y by using either substitution, elimination, or other algebraic methods. Here's one way:\n\nx + y = 630  (multiply both sides by 0.3)\n0.3x + 0.3y = 189\n\n0.6x + 0.3y = 315  (subtract the above equation from this one)\n0.3x = 126\n\nx = 420\n\nSo we need 420 mL of the 60% acid solution, and the remaining amount is y = 630 - x = 210 mL of the 30% solution. We can check that the resulting mixture has the desired concentration:\n\n0.6(420) + 0.3(210) = 252 + 63 = 315 (total amount of acid)\n\n315/630 = 0.5 (concentration)\n\nTherefore, mixing 420 mL of 60% acid solution with 210 mL of 30% solution will result in 630 mL of a 50% solution."}

Then we have:\n\nW = 1 (the field is ploughed once)\n\nLet R be the rate of work for 8 tractors. Then we have:\n\nR = W / (8 * 12) = 1 / 96\n\n(8 tractors can plough 1/96 of the field per day)\n\nTo find the time needed for 15 tractors, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = W / (rate) = 1 / (15 * R)\n\nSubstituting R, we get:\n\ntime = 1 / (15 * 1/96) = 16/5 days\n\nTherefore, it would take 15 tractors (working at the same rate as 8 tractors) 16/5 days to plough the field. Simplifying, we get:\n\ntime = 3.2 days"}

At what price should the retailer mark them so he can sell them at a 20 % discount off the selling price and still make 30 % profit on his cost ?", "response": "\n\nLet x be the selling price, then the discount price is 0.8x. \n\nThe profit is 30% of the cost, which is 0.3 * 80 = 24. \n\nThe selling price minus the cost is the profit, so: \n\nx - 80 = 24 \n\nx = 104 \n\nTherefore, the retailer should mark the pants at $104 so he can sell them at a 20% discount off the selling price and still make a 30% profit on his cost."}

There would had been equal number of boys and girls if there had been 3 more boys and 3 fewer girls . How many girls and boys are in a dance group ?", "response": "\n\nLet's assume the number of girls in the dance group as 5x and the number of boys as 3x.\n\nAccording to the second condition, if there were 3 more boys and 3 fewer girls, the number of girls and boys would be equal. So, the updated number of girls would be (5x - 3) and the updated number of boys would be (3x + 3).\n\nNow, we can form the equation as:\n\n5x = 3x + 3 + 3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x = 6\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the current number of girls in the dance group is:\n\n5x = 5 * 3 = 15\n\nAnd the current number of boys is:\n\n3x = 3 * 3 = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 15 girls and 9 boys in the dance group."}

Right before the work started , they received a new piece of machinery that helped them clean 10 more acres per day than originally planned . As a result of increased productivity in the last day before the deadline they only had to clean 30 acres . How many acres of wheat did the group of farmers have to clean ?", "response": "\n\nLet's call the original planned productivity 'x'. This means that before receiving the new piece of machinery, the group of farmers could clean 80 acres per day, or\n\n80 = x * t\n\nwhere 't' is the number of days it would take to clean all the wheat.\n\nAfter receiving the new machinery, the productivity increased by 10 acres per day, so their new productivity is 'x+10'. We know that on the last day, they only had to clean 30 acres, so\n\n30 = (x+10) * 1\n\nwhere '1' represents the last day of work.\n\nTo find the total amount of wheat they had to clean, we can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for 't':\n\n80 = x * t\n30 = (x+10) * 1\n\n80 = x * t\n30 = x + 10\n\nx = 20\n\nSubstituting this value of 'x' back into the first equation, we find:\n\n80 = 20 * t\n\nt = 4\n\nTherefore, the group of farmers had to clean a total of:\n\n80 * 4 = 320 acres of wheat."}
