The plane then travels back 100 miles with a head wind . The travel time is 40 min more than the first trip .

This means the effective speed of the plane is p+w (the speed of the plane plus the speed of the wind), and we know that:\n\np + w = 100 miles/hour    (Equation 1)\n\nNow, when the plane travels back with a head wind, its effective speed is p-w, and it covers the same 100 miles distance. However, this time the travel time is 40 minutes longer than before (or 1 hour and 40 minutes total).

The right side of the equation represents the total time the plane spent traveling (60 minutes on the first trip plus 40 minutes more). We need to convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.\n\nNow we can solve for one of the variables. Let's solve Equation 1 for p:\n\np = 100 - w\n\nSubstitute this expression for p in Equation 2:\n\n100/(100-w) = (100/60) + (40/60)\n\nSimplify by multiplying both sides by 60(100-w):\n\n6000 = 100(100-w) + 240(100-w)\n\nDistribute and simplify:\n\n6000 = 10000 - 100w + 24000 - 240w\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n0 = -340w + 18000\n\nSolve for w:\n\nw = 18000/340 \u2248 52.94 miles/hour\n\nNow we can use Equation 1 to solve for p:\n\np + 52.94 = 100\n\np \u2248 47.06 miles/hour\n\nTherefore, the speed of the wind is about 52.94 miles/hour, and the speed of the plane is about 47.06 miles/hour.", "prompt_tokens": 75, "completion_tokens": 476, "total_tokens": 551}
