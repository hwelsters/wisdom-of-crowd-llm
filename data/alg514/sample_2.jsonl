Let h be the cost of a hamburger and f be the cost of a serving of french fries. \n\nFrom the problem, we know that David bought 3 hamburgers and 2 servings of french fries for a total of 6.25 dollars. We can set up an equation using the variables we just assigned:\n\n3h + 2f = 6.25\n\nWe also know that a serving of fries costs 0.25 cents more than a hamburger. This means we can set up another equation:\n\nf = h + 0.25\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination.\n\nLet's use substitution. We can rearrange the second equation to solve for h in terms of f:\n\nh = f - 0.25\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for h in the first equation:\n\n3(f - 0.25) + 2f = 6.25\n\nSimplifying and solving for f:\n\n3f - 0.75 + 2f = 6.25\n\n5f = 7\n\nf = 1.40\n\nSo a serving of french fries costs $1.40. We can now substitute this value back into one of the previous equations to solve for h:\n\nh = f - 0.25 = 1.40 - 0.25 = 1.15\n\nSo a hamburger costs $1.15. \n\nTherefore, the cost of a hamburger is 1.15 dollars and the cost of a serving of french fries is 1.40 dollars.", "prompt_tokens": 77, "completion_tokens": 337, "total_tokens": 414}

This means that the total amount of protein in the mixture is 0.13 * 320 = 41.6 pounds.\n\nWe also know that soybean meal is 16% protein and cornmeal is 8% protein.\n\nSo the amount of protein in the soybean meal is 0.16x and the amount of protein in the cornmeal is 0.08y.\n\nSince we want a 320-pound mixture that is 13% protein, we can set up two equations based on the amount of protein and the total weight of the mixture:\n\n0.16x + 0.08y = 41.6  (equation 1)\nx + y = 320   (equation 2)\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using substitution or elimination.\n\nSubstitution method:\n\nSolve equation 2 for one of the variables:\nx + y = 320\nx = 320 - y\n\nSubstitute this expression for x in equation 1:\n0.16x + 0.08y = 41.6\n0.16(320-y) + 0.08y = 41.6\n51.2 - 0.16y + 0.08y = 41.6\n-0.08y = -9.6\ny = 120\n\nNow we can use equation 2 to find x:\nx + y = 320\nx + 120 = 320\nx = 200\n\nTherefore, we need 200 pounds of soybean meal and 120 pounds of cornmeal to make a 320-pound mixture that is 13% protein.\n\nCheck:\nAmount of protein in soybean meal: 0.16 * 200 = 32\nAmount of protein in cornmeal: 0.08 * 120 = 9.6\nTotal amount of protein in mixture: 32 + 9.6 = 41.6\nProtein percentage in mixture: 41.6 / 320 = 0.13 (or 13%)", "prompt_tokens": 58, "completion_tokens": 465, "total_tokens": 523}

Let x be the cost of an MP3 player and y be the cost of a set of headphones.\n\nFrom the first sentence, we know that the first customer bought 5 MP3 players and 8 sets of headphones for a total of 840 dollars. We can write this as an equation:\n\n5x + 8y = 840\n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that the second customer bought 3 MP3 players and 4 sets of headphones for a total of 480 dollars. We can write this as another equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 480\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns (x and y). We can solve for x and y by using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nFirst, we'll multiply the second equation by 5 so that we can eliminate x when we add the equations together:\n\n15x + 20y = 2400\n\nNext, we'll subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(15x + 20y) - (5x + 8y) = 2400 - 840\n\n10x + 12y = 1560\n\nNow we have a new equation with just x and y.

", "response": "Let's call the number of people who ordered the chicken dinner 'x' and the number of people who ordered the steak dinner 'y'. \n\nWe know that there are 6 people in the family, so:\n\nx + y = 6 \n\nWe also know that the total bill was 91.00 dollars. If 'a' represents the number of chicken dinners ordered and 'b' represents the number of steak dinners ordered, we can write:\n\n14.80a + 17.00b = 91.00 \n\nWe don't know 'a' or 'b', but we can use the fact that there are 6 people in the family to write:\n\na + b = 6 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for 'a' and 'b' using substitution or elimination. \n\nLet's use substitution. We can solve the second equation for 'a':\n\na = 6 - b \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for 'a' into the first equation:\n\n(6 - b) + b = 6 \n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n6 - b + b = 6 \n\nThe 'b' terms cancel out:\n\n6 = 6 \n\nThis is true, but it doesn't tell us what 'b' is. We need to use the second equation again:\n\n14.80a + 17.00b = 91.00 \n\nSubstitute 'a = 6 - b':\n\n14.80(6 - b) + 17.00b = 91.00 \n\nDistribute the 14.80:\n\n88.80 - 14.80b + 17.00b = 91.00 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2.20b = 2.20 \n\nDivide both sides by 2.20:\n\nb = 1 \n\nSo one person ordered the steak dinner. We can use the second equation to find out how many people ordered the chicken dinner:\n\n14.80a + 17.00b = 91.00 \n\nSubstitute 'b = 1':\n\n14.80a + 17.00(1) = 91.00 \n\nSimplify:\n\n14.80a + 17.00 = 91.00 \n\nSubtract 17.00 from both sides:\n\n14.80a = 74.00 \n\nDivide both sides by 14.80:\n\na = 5 \n\nSo five people ordered the chicken dinner. \n\nAnswer: \nOne person ordered the steak dinner and five people ordered the chicken dinner.", "prompt_tokens": 86, "completion_tokens": 521, "total_tokens": 607}

We can do this by subtracting the two equations:\n\n(3t + 5e + tax) - (2t + 3e + tax) = 12.70 - 7.80\nt + 2e = 0.98\n\nNow we have one equation with one unknown, which we can use to solve for t or e. Let's solve for t by isolating it:\n\nt = 0.98 - 2e\n\nWe can substitute this expression for t into one of the original equations to solve for e:\n\n2(0.98 - 2e) + 3e + tax = 7.80\n\nSimplifying and solving for e, we get:\n\n-e + tax = 1.42\ne = 1.42 + tax\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for e back into t = 0.98 - 2e to solve for t:\n\nt = 0.98 - 2(1.42 + tax)\nt = -2.86 - 2tax\n\nNow we have expressions for both t and e in terms of the tax.

Looking back, we can see that we made a mistake when subtracting the two equations to eliminate the tax. We should have subtracted the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(3t + 5e + tax) - (2t + 3e + tax) = (12.70 - tax) - (7.80 - tax)\nt + 2e = 4.90\n\nNow, solving for t and e using this equation and the previous steps, we get:\n\nt = 0.10\ne = 2.40\n\nTherefore, each taco costs 10 cents and each enchilada costs $2.40.", "prompt_tokens": 98, "completion_tokens": 610, "total_tokens": 708}
