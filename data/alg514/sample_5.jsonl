The wild cats once won a championship with 60 points. They won 9 more games than they tied. How many wins and how many ties did the Wildcats have?", "response": "Let's call the number of ties the Wildcats had 't' and the number of wins 'w'. \n\nAccording to the problem, we know that:\n\n- Each win is worth 2 points, so the total points from wins is 2w\n- Each tie is worth 1 point, so the total points from ties is t\n- The Wildcats won 9 more games than they tied, so w = t + 9\n\nWe also know that their total points was 60. Using the information above, we can set up an equation:\n\n2w + t = 60\n\nNow we can substitute w = t + 9 into the equation:\n\n2(t + 9) + t = 60\n\nDistribute the 2:\n\n2t + 18 + t = 60\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3t + 18 = 60\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n3t = 42\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nt = 14\n\nSo the Wildcats had 14 ties.
