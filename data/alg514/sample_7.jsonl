We know that David bought 3 hamburgers and 2 servings of french fries for 6.25 dollars, so we can set up an equation:\n\n3h + 2f = 6.25\n\nWe also know that a serving of fries costs 0.25 cents more than a hamburger, which we can write as:\n\nf = h + 0.25\n\nNow we can substitute this equation into the first equation:\n\n3h + 2(h + 0.25) = 6.25\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n5h + 0.5 = 6.25\n\nSubtracting 0.5 from both sides, we get:\n\n5h = 5.75\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nh = 1.15\n\nSo the cost of a hamburger is $1.15. We can plug this value back into the equation we got for f:\n\nf = h + 0.25\nf = 1.15 + 0.25\nf = 1.40\n\nSo the cost of a serving of french fries is $1.40.", "prompt_tokens": 77, "completion_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 337}
