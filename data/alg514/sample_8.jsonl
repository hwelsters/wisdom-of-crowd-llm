Let's solve for 'a': \n\n4000 = 8a - 8w \n\n4000 = 10a + 10w \n\nAdd the two equations together: \n\n8000 = 18a + 2w \n\nSimplify: \n\n4000 = 9a + w \n\nNow we have a third equation that relates 'a' and 'w'. We can substitute this equation into one of the previous equations to solve for either variable. Let's substitute it into the first equation we had: \n\n4000 = (a - w) * 8 \n\n4000 = (a - (9a-4000)) * 8 \n\n4000 = (-8a + 4000) * 8 \n\n500 = -8a + 4000 \n\n3500 = 8a \n\na = 437.5 \n\nNow we can use any of the three equations we found to solve for 'w'.

Find the cost of each pair of jeans and each shirt.", "response": "Let's use algebra to solve this problem. \n\nLet's call the cost of one pair of jeans 'j' and the cost of one shirt 's'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that: \n\n3j + 6s = 104.25 \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that: \n\n4j + 5s = 112.15 \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can use elimination or substitution to solve for j and s. \n\nLet's use elimination: \n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 4 to get: \n\n12j + 24s = 417 \n\nNow we can subtract the second equation from this one: \n\n12j + 24s - 4j - 5s = 305.85 \n\nSimplify: \n\n8j + 19s = 305.85 \n\nNow we can use this equation and the first equation to solve for j and s: \n\n3j + 6s = 104.25 \n\n8j + 19s = 305.85 \n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 8 to get: \n\n24j + 48s = 833 \n\nNow we can subtract the first equation from the second one: \n\n24j + 48s - 24j - 45s = 201.6 \n\nSimplify: \n\n3s = 201.6 \n\nDivide both sides by 3: \n\ns = 67.2 \n\nNow we know that one shirt costs $67.2. \n\nWe can substitute this value back into one of the equations to solve for j. Let's use the first equation: \n\n3j + 6s = 104.25 \n\n3j + 6(67.2) = 104.25 \n\n3j + 403.2 = 104.25 \n\nSubtract 403.2 from both sides: \n\n3j = -298.95 \n\nDivide both sides by 3: \n\nj = -99.65 \n\nUh oh, we got a negative value for j. This means our equations have no solution that makes sense. \n\nLet's double-check our work and make sure we didn't make any mistakes. \n\nWe can also try using substitution to solve, and see if we get the same answer: \n\nFrom the first equation, we know that: \n\ns = (104.25 - 3j)/6 \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation: \n\n4j + 5s = 112.15 \n\n4j + 5((104.25 - 3j)/6) = 112.15 \n\nSimplify: \n\n8j + 5(104.25 - 3j) = 672.9 \n\n8j + 521.25 - 15j = 672.9 \n\nSimplify: \n\n-7j = 151.65 \n\nDivide both sides by -7: \n\nj = -21.665 \n\nAgain, we got a negative value for j. We made a mistake somewhere, but we're not sure where. \n\nLet's try one last approach and see if we catch our mistake. \n\nWe can use a system of equations to solve this problem: \n\n3j + 6s = 104.25 \n\n4j + 5s = 112.15 \n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to get: \n\n12j + 24s = 417 \n\n12j + 15s = 336.45 \n\nNow we can subtract the second equation from the first one: \n\n12j + 24s - 12j - 15s = 80.55 \n\nSimplify: \n\n9s = 80.55 \n\nDivide both sides by 9: \n\ns = 8.95 \n\nNow we know that one shirt costs $8.95. \n\nWe can substitute this value back into one of the equations to solve for j. Let's use the first equation: \n\n3j + 6s = 104.25 \n\n3j + 6(8.95) = 104.25 \n\n3j + 53.7 = 104.25 \n\nSubtract 53.7 from both sides: \n\n3j = 50.55 \n\nDivide both sides by 3: \n\nj = 16.85 \n\nNow we have a solution that makes sense: one pair of jeans costs $16.85 and one shirt costs $8.95. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nEach pair of jeans costs $16.85 and each shirt costs $8.95.", "prompt_tokens": 60, "completion_tokens": 960, "total_tokens": 1020}
