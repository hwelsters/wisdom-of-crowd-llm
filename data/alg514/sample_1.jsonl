We know that the worker worked a total of 50 hours, so:\n\nx + y = 50\n\nWe also know how much the worker earned for the week. The amount earned for ordinary time is 60 cents an hour times the number of ordinary hours worked, or 0.6x. The amount earned for overtime is 90 cents an hour times the number of overtime hours worked, or 0.9y. So:\n\n0.6x + 0.9y = 32.40\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other in one equation, and substitute that expression into the other equation.

", "response": "Let's call the cost of an MP3 player 'x' and the cost of a set of headphones 'y'.\nUsing this information, we can create two equations based on the two purchases:\n5x + 8y = 840 \n3x + 4y = 480 \n\nNow, we can solve for x and y using a system of equations. One way to do this is to use substitution. We can rearrange one of the equations to solve for one of the variables, and then substitute that expression into the other equation. Here's one possible method:\n\n3x + 4y = 480   -->   3x = 480 - 4y   -->   x = (480 - 4y)/3\n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n5x + 8y = 840 \n5((480-4y)/3) + 8y = 840 \n\nSimplify and solve for y:\n\n1600 - 20y + 24y = 2520 \n4y = 920 \ny = 230 \n\nNow that we know y = 230, we can substitute this value back into either of the original equations to solve for x:\n\n3x + 4y = 480 \n3x + 4(230) = 480 \n3x = 80 \nx = 80/3 \n\nSo the cost of an MP3 player is approximately $26.67, and the cost of a set of headphones is $230.", "prompt_tokens": 84, "completion_tokens": 311, "total_tokens": 395}
