", "response": "Let's call the price of the belt 'b'. \n\nAccording to the problem, the price of the pants is 2.93 less than the belt, so we can write: \n\nPrice of pants = b - 2.93 \n\nWe also know that the total cost of the pants and belt together is 70.93, so we can write: \n\nPrice of pants + Price of belt = 70.93 \n\nNow we can substitute in the first equation: \n\n(b - 2.93) + b = 70.93 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n2b - 2.93 = 70.93 \n\nAdding 2.93 to both sides: \n\n2b = 73.86 \n\nDividing both sides by 2: \n\nb = 36.93 \n\nSo the belt costs 36.93 dollars. \n\nTo find the price of the pants, we can use the first equation: \n\nPrice of pants = b - 2.93 \n\nPrice of pants = 36.93 - 2.93 \n\nPrice of pants = 34 \n\nSo the pants cost 34 dollars.", "prompt_tokens": 63, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 294}

We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nFor the first leg of the trip (going West), the plane is flying into the wind. So the effective speed of the plane is:\n\np - w\n\nWe know that the distance traveled is 780 miles and the time is 2 hours.

So the effective speed of the plane is:\n\np + w\n\nWe know that the distance traveled is still 780 miles, but the time is now 1.5 hours.
