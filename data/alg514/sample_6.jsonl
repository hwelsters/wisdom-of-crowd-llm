So, we can set up an equation for the amount of copper in the final solution:\n\n0.25x + 0.5y = 450 \n\nWe now have two equations with two variables, and we can solve for x and y. One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 0.25 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n0.25x + 0.5y = 450 \n-0.25x - 0.25y = -0.25(1000 - x)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0.25y = 200 - 0.25x \n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nx + (200 - 0.25x) = 1000 \n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.75x = 800 \n\nx = 1066.67 \n\nWe can now use either of the original equations to solve for y. Using the first equation, we get:\n\n1066.67 + y = 1000 \n\ny = -66.67 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't have a negative amount of solution. \n\nHowever, if we use the second equation to solve for y, we get:\n\n0.25x + 0.5y = 450 \n\n0.25(1066.67) + 0.5y = 450 \n\n266.67 + 0.5y = 450 \n\n0.5y = 183.33 \n\ny = 366.67 \n\nSo, Arianne should mix 1066.67 milliliters of the 25% solution and 366.67 milliliters of the 50% solution to make 1000 milliliters of a 45% solution with 450 milliliters of copper.", "prompt_tokens": 76, "completion_tokens": 530, "total_tokens": 606}
