# **Wisdom of the Crowd on LLMs**

***

# **I. Abstract**
In various problem domains, it has been observed that the aggregate opinions of a group can outperform the results of any one individual in the group. We study the aggregate performance of a commercially available LLM known as ChatGPT across 10 nondeterministic runs through the question sets DRAW-1K, ALG-514 and NLU-ASDIV. We find the aggregate using majority voting performs better in terms of providing more accurate responses and fewer wrong responses compared to any individual run. Later on, we propose various election methods for selecting the best response from the various sample solutions which appears to bring about even greater improvements in performance. The dataset of ChatGPTâ€™s responses to the various question sets are also released.

# **II. Introduction**
The "wisdom of the crowd" refers to the theory that when independent judgements are combined it can produce a final judgement with greater accuracy. Due to the non-determinism of LLMs such as ChatGPT, we treat each sample solution provided by ChatGPT as an independent judgement in this experiment.  

# **III. Materials and Methods**
I made use of the following tool to collect ChatGPT's responses: https://github.com/aardoh/sleepyask. sleepyask is a tool I made which allows me to collect responses from ChatGPT faster since it applies the producer-consumer problem in order to ask multiple questions in parallel.  
  
The question sets used in this experiment are:
- DRAW-1K
- ALG-514
- NLU-ASDIV
  
### **Majority voting**
In this repo, majority voting has the following definition. We select only numbers that appear greater than or equal to `[num of sample solutions] / 2` times
For example, given the following solutions
| Solution 1 | Solution 2 | Solution 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 0 | 6 |

The following majority solution will be created:
| Solution |
| --- |
| 1 | 
| 6 |

Since both 1 and 6 appear 2 times where `2 > 3 / 2 = 1.5`

## **Election methods**
Instead of getting the majority vote response, we also use various election methods for selecting a single representative sample among the various solutions.  
The various methods are as follows:  
- `Levenshtein distance` - We look at the levenshtein distance between the sample solution and the majority solution. We select the one with the smallest levenshtein distance.   
- `Most majority` - We select the sample solution where the intersection between the sample solution and the majority solution has the greatest size.  
- `Longest` - We select the sample solution with greatest set size.  

## **Extracting answers**
We extract all decimals from ChatGPT's entire response. For example, given the text `1 + 1 = 2`, the solution will be `[1, 2]`. Of course, this isn't 100% accurate. As such, this will only be an estimate of ChatGPT's performance. However, based on what we have seen of ChatGPT's responses, it is a fairly reasonable estimate. If there is a more accurate to do this programmatically, we are open to suggestions.  

# **Results**
The important columns are:  
- `sample_[num]` - Results of the solutions from sample [num]
- `majority` - This is the results of the solutions that are created by selecting values that appear a majority amount of times.  
- `levenshtein_correct` - This is the results of the solutions that are created by electing the array with the shortest levenshtein distance to the majority among the samples.  
- `most_majority_correct` - This is the results of the solutions that are created by electing the array with the most elements from the majority array among the samples.
- `max_size_correct` - This is the results of the solutions that are created by electing the array with the maximum size among the samples.
- `sample_average` - The average across all samples.


The distribution of ChatGPT's response correctness.  
- `all` - This means ChatGPT's solution contains all the solution in the response.  
- `none` - This means ChatGPT's solution did not contain the solution in its response at all.  
- `some` - This means ChatGPT's solution contains some of the solution in the response but not all of it.

## **Potential issues**
- ChatGPT's responses and the actual solution are all rounded to 3 decimals since ChatGPT likes to round irrational numbers. This could possibly create some problems. However, it seems to be pretty reasonable so far.  
- In the experiment, we check the entire response for decimals and include it in the solution. If there is a more accurate to do this, I am open to suggestions. As such, one possible argument against this method is that the majority array might simply be larger and ChatGPT simply "casts a wider net" in which it may be lucky. In this experiment, we attempt to show that on average, the majority array is often similarly sized, if not smaller, than its individual sample solutions. Furthermore, we use `Longest` as an election method and it doesn't perform as well, attempting to counteract this argument.

## **Things left to do**
- Reason WHY majority vote performs better. Try to explain why wisdom of the crowd works on LLMs?  
- Reason WHY election methods work? For example, I am quite confused as to why most majority would work better than majority. Are there numbers that appear very often that are important that aren't part of the solution?  
- Draw a few conclusions from this.
