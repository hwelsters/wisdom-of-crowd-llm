## Wisdom of the Crowd on LLM

It is possible that the aggregate opinions of a group of LLMs can outperform the opinions of any constituent individual.  

This repo details my experiments in figuring out whether or not this is the case.  

I have done this experiment on two datasets, and it appears to be the case so far.  
The datasets in which I have tried this on are:
- DRAW-1K
- ALG-514
